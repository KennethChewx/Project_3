In this weekly thread, industry folk can post upcoming deals or other promotions their companies are holding, or promote new products to /r/Coffee subscribers! Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.

- More rules may be added as needed. If you're not sure whether or not whatever you're posting is acceptable, message the mods and ask!

So, being myself and not wanting to spend $20-$30 on what is just a different take on something I already have, a cone dripper, I thought “why not try my kalita filters in my v60?”

Still good.

I used for a while an old , probably more then seventy years old, hand grinder with metal burr inherited by my grandparents which could not be disassembled, so I used to just clean it once in a while with the help of a brush.

However I recently switched to a more modern, adjustable, Hario hand grinder with ceramic burr and since this one can easily be disassembled and washed I wonder how often I should wash the ceramic burr. Unfortunately in the instruction manual there is no suggestion.

So I wonder: how often do you wash you burr? How often do you do it? 
Could this create any problem (washing or not washing) with the quality of the grind?

This was all discovered through conversations with the guys that work in their stores and although I knew that this kind of thing happens there I was surprised that a British, now Coca Cola owned, company is doing it. This is what I’ve learned so far, I’m still in contact with some of the guys so could reach out to them if anyone has questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Costa Staff don’t have their work visas provided by the company that runs the franchise out there. The company uses third parties, either Saudi individuals or companies to get work visas for their staff. Although this isn’t technically illegal it’s very shady.
2. During training a trainee was physically assaulted by a manager/trainer. He described it as “a smack” and indicated that he was hit somewhere on his upper body.
3. Staff have gone for several months without being paid. The longest period that I’m aware of was five months. These are people from developing countries who mostly traveled to Saudi to make money so that they can support their families back home. They were literally living off of the contents of the tip jar for five months.
4. Companies that employ foreign workers in Saudi have to provide them with either accommodation or an accommodation allowance. Costa provides them with an allowance of 200 Riyals per month, this is the equivalent of $54 and leads to their staff living in really cramped conditions in small apartments. I’m told up to five a room in some cases.
5. Many of the staff have been made to work seven days a week with no overtime. Even in Saudi this is illegal.
6. Some staff have been made to work in a store alone all day with no breaks. In one of these cases the store would open at 5am and closed at 8pm. The guy would show up at 4:30am and leave around 9pm for days in row.
7. After staff have finished their contract they often have to remain in Saudi, unpaid, for a month or more (sometimes two) while Costa arranges their flight home. The guys I spoke to were never really sure why but they were told by management that they were “waiting for a cheap flight”. This is unlikely to be the case and probably has something to do with their visas.
8. At least one of the stores is on a compound which is mostly inhabited by westerners. Costa get a unit in the small shopping center there rent free and the Costa staff are accommodated on the compound with the other guys that work there. When one of the Costa staff finished his contract he remained in his accommodation on the compound until Costa had arranged his flight which took over a month. After he’d left the compound’s management billed Costa for the time he was living there but not working. Costa deducted this cost from the SALARIES of their two staff that were still working in the store on the compound.
9. Around five years ago Costa accused one of their staff of petty theft, something which he denied. Costa filed a police report but the police were apparently unwilling or unable to anything due to lack of evidence without the staff member signing a confession, something he refused to do. Costa then fired him but refused to release his passport and iqama (work visa)………… for five years. The guy was in a foreign country for five years unable to travel home or find another job. He lived off of the charity of other Costa staff the whole time and was told by Costa management that if he signed a confession he would have to serve a year in prison and would then be sent home. I have a copy of the police report and had an Arabic speaker look at it. Had he signed it he would have apparently not only been given prison time but lashes too. The latter is something I’m told he was completely unaware of. He is apparently back home now but how he lasted half a decade under those conditions I do not know.

They’ve done other shady stuff like using non-Costa beans and misleading customers about their source (I can get photo evidence of this) but I wanted to focus on the way they treat their staff with this post.

I just wanted to get the word out about some of the things western companies and their franchises get up to in the Gulf. If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask. I’m also open to suggestions about how I could get this out to a wider audience.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Costa Coffee in Saudi Arabia treat their staff terribly by doing things like withholding wages and physically assaulting them, in one case they even prevented someone from leaving the country for five years.

&lt;li&gt;After staff have finished their contract they often have to remain in Saudi, unpaid, for a month or more (sometimes two) while Costa arranges their flight home. The guys I spoke to were never really sure why but they were told by management that they were “waiting for a cheap flight”. This is unlikely to be the case and probably has something to do with their visas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least one of the stores is on a compound which is mostly inhabited by westerners. Costa get a unit in the small shopping center there rent free and the Costa staff are accommodated on the compound with the other guys that work there. When one of the Costa staff finished his contract he remained in his accommodation on the compound until Costa had arranged his flight which took over a month. After he’d left the compound’s management billed Costa for the time he was living there but not working. Costa deducted this cost from the SALARIES of their two staff that were still working in the store on the compound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around five years ago Costa accused one of their staff of petty theft, something which he denied. Costa filed a police report but the police were apparently unwilling or unable to anything due to lack of evidence without the staff member signing a confession, something he refused to do. Costa then fired him but refused to release his passport and iqama (work visa)………… for five years. The guy was in a foreign country for five years unable to travel home or find another job. He lived off of the charity of other Costa staff the whole time and was told by Costa management that if he signed a confession he would have to serve a year in prison and would then be sent home. I have a copy of the police report and had an Arabic speaker look at it. Had he signed it he would have apparently not only been given prison time but lashes too. The latter is something I’m told he was completely unaware of. He is apparently back home now but how he lasted half a decade under those conditions I do not know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve done other shady stuff like using non-Costa beans and misleading customers about their source (I can get photo evidence of this) but I wanted to focus on the way they treat their staff with this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to get the word out about some of the things western companies and their franchises get up to in the Gulf. If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask. I’m also open to suggestions about how I could get this out to a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR Costa Coffee in Saudi Arabia treat their staff terribly by doing things like withholding wages and physically assaulting them, in one case they even prevented someone from leaving the country for five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I typically drink a local roasters medium roast. They claim it&amp;#39;s a 60% Guatemala, 20% Kenya, and 20% Brasil mix. I drink this or a dark roast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with that in mind, any recommendations for Keurig pods that can pull off a half-decent coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks for the suggestions. I take a Klean Kanteen with coffee to work already, but sometimes I drink all of that and want some more so that is why I am looking at the Keurig stuff. Kind of an on-hand stash situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also really appreciate the upvotes. Nice to know what kind of sub you&amp;#39;re subscribed too. /s&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn&amp;#39;t ever that big a deal when it was just me, but now combined, we spend like $60-$70/month on coffee, which is a pretty hefty chunk of our grocery budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone found themselves in a similar situation? Did you just swallow the cost? Or did you change anything?&lt;/p&gt;

Since I can't brew at work, every weekday I make one big brew using 31g of coffee and 480g of water to yield just shy of 16oz of coffee. Until recently I had been using a V60 size 02 for this. I've practiced on the V60 for the past couple of years, and over the past year or so I've improved my grinder, my water, and my brewing technique considerably. In general I had been getting reasonably good results with these 31g V60 brews that I felt did the coffees justice.

On the other hand, on weekends I do various smaller brews using 18g in a Kalita 155. As on weekdays, on weekends I use a 15.5:1 water:coffee ratio and a Lido 3 grinder. In contrast to my weekday brews, the 18g 155 brews have been consistently amazing. In fact, much of the best coffee I've ever tasted I made using these parameters. Once dialed in precisely, the flavors are always super intense and well articulated and the balance and finish are excellent. Whereas the 31g V60 brews are somewhat dull, the 18g 155 brews are resonant.

That's why I switched to the Kalita 185 for my larger weekday brews--I figured I must be missing out and switched devices thinking the Wave might just be a better brewer (at least to my palate). As an initial matter, there's no obvious reason why either the V60 02 or the Kalita 185 would be more or less suitable for 31g; they have very similar dimensions and are recommended for similar quantities of coffee by the manufacturers.

Yet the results of the switch have been dramatic. The 31g brews in the 185 reliably have had better flavor clarity, more pronounced but finer acidity, and more sweetness as compared to the same size brews in the V60 02. At first I thought this confirmed my hypothesis, that the Wave is just a better brewer (again, at least for me).

However, based on a few comments I read here, I started thinking about the *relationship* between the dose and the brewer and whether that relationship, rather than the brewers by themselves, could explain the differences in taste. A couple of knowledgeable folks (mainly u/CommunistWitchDr) have argued that pour-over brewers in fact have narrow optimal ranges of doses and that going outside of those ranges leads to worse coffee.

The reasoning goes like this. Bed depth (which is a direct function of dose) strongly relates to flow rate, so as bed depth goes down, you need to grind finer and finer to get a good extraction. Finer grinds are generally desirable because they're more even than coarser grinds and therefore support more even extraction. However, grinding finer also creates more fines, because fines are generated as the coffee is broken apart. And, in addition to other problems, fines cause channeling--very briefly, uneven resistance to the water flowing through the coffee bed which causes water to ""channel,"" i.e. concentrate in particular areas and over-extract the adjacent grounds in the process. This can potentially ruin the flavor of an otherwise good pour-over.

By the same token, as bed depth goes up, you need to grind coarser and coarser to avoid killing the flow rate. The issues with coarse grinding are that (1) it's less even than finer grinding, and therefore leads to less even extraction, and (2) it's much less efficient because it exposes much less of the coffee's soluble material to water. At least for my taste preferences, coarse grinding should generally be avoided.

Taken together, these observations suggest that each pour-over brewer has an optimal range of doses. This is because each brewer has a unique shape and capacity, which together determine bed depth, which in turn dictates grind size. In the optimal range, the grind is fine enough to get a good, even extraction but not so fine that channeling becomes a problem.

This is not only supported by scientific theory--it has been borne out in my experience. The Kalita 185 brews 31g beautifully--with similar flavor clarity at presumably similar extraction levels as my favorite 18g 155 brews--but the V60 02 does not. Of course, the V60 is more than capable of producing incredible coffee, but it needs the right dose/grind to do so. This idea is also consistent with many pros' recommendations for V60 brewing, which typically involve around 22g doses for the 02 (and rarely, if ever, more than 25g).

I don't mean to suggest that this is a novel insight; it's not.

If you haven't already, I recommend evaluating if your dose makes sense for whatever pour-over brewer you're using, as well as experimenting with different doses in different brewers.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;All,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I can&amp;#39;t brew at work, every weekday I make one big brew using 31g of coffee and 480g of water to yield just shy of 16oz of coffee. Until recently I had been using a V60 size 02 for this. I&amp;#39;ve practiced on the V60 for the past couple of years, and over the past year or so I&amp;#39;ve improved my grinder, my water, and my brewing technique considerably. In general I had been getting reasonably good results with these 31g V60 brews that I felt did the coffees justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, on weekends I do various smaller brews using 18g in a Kalita 155. As on weekdays, on weekends I use a 15.5:1 water:coffee ratio and a Lido 3 grinder. In contrast to my weekday brews, the 18g 155 brews have been consistently amazing. In fact, much of the best coffee I&amp;#39;ve ever tasted I made using these parameters. Once dialed in precisely, the flavors are always super intense and well articulated and the balance and finish are excellent. Whereas the 31g V60 brews are somewhat dull, the 18g 155 brews are resonant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I switched to the Kalita 185 for my larger weekday brews--I figured I must be missing out and switched devices thinking the Wave might just be a better brewer (at least to my palate). As an initial matter, there&amp;#39;s no obvious reason why either the V60 02 or the Kalita 185 would be more or less suitable for 31g; they have very similar dimensions and are recommended for similar quantities of coffee by the manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the results of the switch have been dramatic. The 31g brews in the 185 reliably have had better flavor clarity, more pronounced but finer acidity, and more sweetness as compared to the same size brews in the V60 02. At first I thought this confirmed my hypothesis, that the Wave is just a better brewer (again, at least for me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, based on a few comments I read here, I started thinking about the &lt;em&gt;relationship&lt;/em&gt; between the dose and the brewer and whether that relationship, rather than the brewers by themselves, could explain the differences in taste. A couple of knowledgeable folks (mainly &lt;a href=""/u/CommunistWitchDr""&gt;u/CommunistWitchDr&lt;/a&gt;) have argued that pour-over brewers in fact have narrow optimal ranges of doses and that going outside of those ranges leads to worse coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasoning goes like this. Bed depth (which is a direct function of dose) strongly relates to flow rate, so as bed depth goes down, you need to grind finer and finer to get a good extraction. Finer grinds are generally desirable because they&amp;#39;re more even than coarser grinds and therefore support more even extraction. However, grinding finer also creates more fines, because fines are generated as the coffee is broken apart. And, in addition to other problems, fines cause channeling--very briefly, uneven resistance to the water flowing through the coffee bed which causes water to &amp;quot;channel,&amp;quot; i.e. concentrate in particular areas and over-extract the adjacent grounds in the process. This can potentially ruin the flavor of an otherwise good pour-over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the same token, as bed depth goes up, you need to grind coarser and coarser to avoid killing the flow rate. The issues with coarse grinding are that (1) it&amp;#39;s less even than finer grinding, and therefore leads to less even extraction, and (2) it&amp;#39;s much less efficient because it exposes much less of the coffee&amp;#39;s soluble material to water. At least for my taste preferences, coarse grinding should generally be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these observations suggest that each pour-over brewer has an optimal range of doses. This is because each brewer has a unique shape and capacity, which together determine bed depth, which in turn dictates grind size. In the optimal range, the grind is fine enough to get a good, even extraction but not so fine that channeling becomes a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not only supported by scientific theory--it has been borne out in my experience. The Kalita 185 brews 31g beautifully--with similar flavor clarity at presumably similar extraction levels as my favorite 18g 155 brews--but the V60 02 does not. Of course, the V60 is more than capable of producing incredible coffee, but it needs the right dose/grind to do so. This idea is also consistent with many pros&amp;#39; recommendations for V60 brewing, which typically involve around 22g doses for the 02 (and rarely, if ever, more than 25g).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mean to suggest that this is a novel insight; it&amp;#39;s not. I wanted to share anyway because it took me a while to fully understand, and has had a major, practical impact on the quality of my brewing. If you haven&amp;#39;t already, I recommend evaluating if your dose makes sense for whatever pour-over brewer you&amp;#39;re using, as well as experimenting with different doses in different brewers.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm the head barista of a cafe.  We have a 2 group Linea PB ABR.  For the past year or so we've had an issue with the heads pulling a shot differently(7 second difference) despite using the same exact set up.

I've run water through and weighed everything out, everything is spot on.  The only other thing that I think could be affecting the shot times this greatly would be that the head on the left doesn't seem to be perfectly level.  

  
Anybody out there have an issue with this machine or a similar one before?  Would a not entirely level group head lead to shots pulling at different times?

I have a really tiny kitchen and live in a noisy apartment where my downstairs neighbour will make my life miserable if I wake her up in the early morning with a coffee grinder :)

As I have learned the most important thing is a good grinder, I want to pick either the Eureka mignon Silenzio (369 eur =  416 usd)  or Eureka Mignon Specialita (429 eur = 484 usd), as they are both small and really quiet. Would the Specialita be worth the extra 70 euro's?

I would like to be able to make a good espresso and will use the machine a lot for making lattes. I would also like to learn more about making espresso but I am not sure if at this moment I can/want to spend a lot of time on it.

I previously opted for the Breville infuser, but after noticing the Bambino plus this seems like a really good choice as its a) Really small b) Startup time 3secs (I am always in a hurry in the  morning. c) The automatic frother function that actually makes microfoam froth really calls my name and saves time! d) Seems to be a bit easier in use, so I wont have a lot of wasted shots/frustration?

As there is the option to do manual frothing as well and I can buy non-pressurised baskets, there would be some opportunity for me to have a bit of a learning curve I guess?

I can get the Bambino plus for 449 eur (= 506 usd), which seems a bit steep for what you get, and the infuser for 473 eur (=533 usd). The infuser is not big but still twice as wide as the Bambino. It does have a hot water outlet en seems to be more advanced than the Bambino and I am not sure yet if that is actually a pro or a con... Too bad it lacks the automatic frothing function though.

In the picture you see two different beans. One darker than the other. Is the very dark one still too oily or does it pass? In my sight it doesn't have much oil on it. The darkest one is a Starbucks Espresso roast and the slightly lighter Cafe Noir organic.

Cool your hot, freshly brewed coffee in a cocktail shaker full of ice. 

So this is the recipe. You will either need a higher concentration of coffee or just deal with slightly watery coffee. Imo it’s not that watery.

- Fill a metal (must be metal) cocktail shaker with ice. 
- Let it sit and chill closed while your coffee brews. This is awesome if you use a k-cup or similar machines. 
- While it brews, make sure to add any cream and sugar to your shaker. This is also where you can add other fancy stuff too like flavorings.
- Fill the cup you plan on drinking coffee out of with ice (you can add your cream or flavorings here instead, but I highly suggest adding sugar directly to the shaker)
- Pour slightly less coffee than you would normally use into the shaker. You can do this immediately after brewing, or even brew the cup directly in the shaker if it fits under your k-cup spout. 
- Shake your cocktail shaker. You should feel the outside of the shaker go cold in seconds. Shake until the outside is basically ice cold to the touch.
- Take the small lid off the shaker and strain the coffee through the lid into your cup of ice.
- Enjoy!

I make coffee like this at my work everyday (we have a k-cup machine) since I don’t like hot coffee. Also, I keep my shaker in the freezer at work so it is constantly ice cold.

Awesome little device and looks great on the counter-top, or anywhere, really. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I pulled two shots, from a semi-automatic (with PID control) and the Flair. I tried to use the same variables 14g / 27 secs brew time (this is how I usually pull this type of bean from the semi-automatic; I also set the temp at 195F which was recommended by the roaster) and same grind level. The shot from the Flair came out a tad bit bitter and a more watery (and a lot less crema). I think it was an okay shot for milk-based drink, but a bit lacking if it’s straight up. 

My kettle doesn’t have temperature control and the manual force to pull down is not as consistent (and I don’t know whether I’m pulling 30lbs) since I don’t have the pressure gauge, but I tried to keep my process consistent throughout by first warming up the brew head once the water from the kettle is boiled, then proceed to grind out the beans and pour water into the chamber.

My one issue now is that the rubber steamer is quite short and hard to get into the mill correctly. I have seen a few tutorials on fitting a metal steam wand from a Rancilio, but as he machine is new I don’t really want to be opening it up. Has anyone tried attaching a metal steamer via a rubber connector to the arm, or using a longer rubber steamer from a different machine? Just curious about non invasive improvements

We do have an older french press as a fallback. It works well but ours is a bit difficult to clean (lots of small edges in the plunger and grounds get stuck under the mesh screen)

Wanted to get your thoughts on the taste profile of brewed coffee from grinding frozen beans vs. room temp ground beans.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to be universally accepted that if you want to preserve the taste of coffee for a month or longer, then vacuum sealed freezing is probably the best way to do it. Here is a Redditor reporing a [1-month taste test](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/8ynqfc/george_howell_on_freezing_coffee/) with an outcome favoring the frozen beans, and a good discussion can be found at that link.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm curious about is the taste profile of grinding the frozen beans vs. letting them thaw and grinding them at room temp. Which creates a superior cup?

&amp;#x200B;

Opinion: I prefer the taste of the coffee from the room-temp ground beans. More below

=====================

Context:

[George Howell](http://www.georgehowellcoffee.com/knowledge/notes-from-george/) (see issue 2 on this page) recommends grinding the frozen beans as they grind more evenly .

[This nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep24483) (figure 4), shows a more narrow grind distribution AND a shift towards finer grind particles the colder the beans are when ground.

The author of this [excellent coffee blog,](https://coffeeadastra.com) recommends thawing the beans a few hours prior to grinding given the larger number of fines. (click on the V60 recipe link to read about it).

====================

Very unofficial taste test:

Using a Colombian from Heart coffee, I brewed with my V60, a Comandante and third wave water on day 10 after roast. Dialing in, I ultimately landed on click 23.  Round, delicious, balanced flavor.  Lingering, tasty finish.

I then froze those beans overnight (not-vacuum sealed, simply in a zip lock bag) and ground them frozen the next morning using the same recipe. The flavor was a little more... sharp? Not as round. Not as balanced. Played around with a click finer, a click courser, and found that one click courser produced a better cup, but still not quite as round and balanced as the beans at room-temp.

I thawed them overnight and brewed again the next day. Back to click 23. Again, an excellent, round, balanced cup. From my memory, very similar to the excellent cup on the first brew, day 10 off roast, with the room-temp beans.

&amp;#x200B;

I could theorize a little and suggest that it makes sense I preferred a courser grind setting with the frozen beans, if in fact the frozen grind leads to a finder grind (at the same grind setting). Though if the distribution is tighter with the frozen grind, then I would have thought this would lead to more cup clarity and thus a preferred taste. But this wasn't the case.  Of course, this is just ONE test with ONE type of bean. So, yeah, very unscientific. Essentially this is just fodder for conversation more than anything else.

My question is, I talked to customer service the other day and they said when I get to about 10, I should hear the burrs start to touch at that point. I hear it at around 13. Do I need to take the entire thing apart and put it back together after I move some spacers around? Has anyone lived with this? I'm assuming I can just move my pour over grind up to a 22 instead of an 19 to compensate?

Some tips for people doing this in the future:

1) Getting the case off is a bitch. Pry in with a screwdriver, and slide the case off as you hold the top part of the case to make it easier

2) To take the shaft off of the burr, you need to hold the burr with a towel (or you'll rip your skin off) and turn the shaft while in the towel with a wrench. It should pop off with some force.

3) Some people complained about the beans not grinding after repair. Make sure that the red wire that you connect is plugged to the + point on the circuit board in the unit.

All in all, 10/10, would fix again in 2 years.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, pretty excited how easy the whole process was, especially with Baratza&amp;#39;s customer service.

About a year and a half ago, I purchased the Capresso 565.05 burr grinder, and I’ve been using it since. I typically find myself using Fine 3 for espresso, Medium 1 or 2 for pour-over, and the coarsest it’ll go for French press/cold brew.

Anyway, I’ve been thinking of looking for a solid replacement. I dropped $99 on the Capresso, but I’m not opposed spending more. This brought me to the Baratza Encore, and my only worries are:
-if it’s even at all more consistent than what I currently have

I went on my first trip bringing my own coffee setup.  It took up [over 2/3](https://imgur.com/a/lUjX6ju) of my carry on suitcase!  I did put additional clothes over it but you can clearly see how much room it took up.  I could have taken the stuff out of the boxes, but I don't think it would have saved much room.  So now since I'm more serious into coffee and I have a couple of long trips overseas plus camping trips, I decided to put together a real travel setup.  This is designed for maximum compactness, ie air travel.  if you're not traveling by air and have more room to bring stuff, then you can modify as needed.

&amp;#x200B;

[Now here's what I'm currently using.](https://imgur.com/a/Gg6ALI4)

&amp;#x200B;

1, Aeropress with tote bag - $31.95 [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018RY8H0](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018RY8H0)

I went with the aeropress since I prefer it over the drippers, and so the rest of my equipment is slightly more geared towards having an aeropress, but you can use a v60 or whatever method you like.  I do see that an [Aeropress Go](https://dailycoffeenews.com/2019/03/15/aeropress-on-the-move-with-the-forthcoming-aeropress-go/) will be released in the fall which is slightly smaller and every will fit into a travel cup, so that might be worth looking into as well when it comes out, but right now the standard aeropress makes the perfect sized cup for me right now \~230ml.  One thing I really hate is that the filter cap can't be attached when the plunger is all the way pressed, I feel like I could just shave off some plastic on the filter cap to get it to screw in since it's really the notches that are too thick preventing it from turning.  The exposed rubber on the plunger gets excessively dirty from random stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Aeropress filter container - $6.00 [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FSQ2LHW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FSQ2LHW)

This is great for protecting and holding the filters.  It holds about 100 filters.  Definitely enough for say a month's worth.  Or you can get a metal filter, but I prefer the paper ones.  Also, you can even reuse the paper filters up to 80 times according to the inventor, just rinse an dry after each use.

&amp;#x200B;

3. .5L Kettle Dual Voltage - $32.99 [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JDZHJV](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JDZHJV)

The black carrying bag came with the kettle and it fits everything nicely.  You can save some bucks and get a non dual voltage kettle.  The thing is so light and tiny that it's pretty easy to control the pour, so no gooseneck needed.  Super amazed at the size of this kettle, so tiny compared to the 1.7L.  It also boils water in 2:30, and is dual voltage (though on 220V they say it takes longer to boil water).  Will be useful to have when I travel overseas, also came with a travel adapter.  I know a lot of places will have hot water capabilities, but I don't want to leave anything to chance.  For camping, I have a regular 2qt stovetop kettle, space won't be an issue for camping.

&amp;#x200B;

4. 0.1g Scale - $10.99 [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DGEWHN4](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DGEWHN4)

Having a scale is a must, you can buy one with a built in timer as well, but those are bigger or more expensive, I just used my phone as the timer.  I found this scale was pretty accurate using the weight of a US quarter as 5.670 grams it consistently read between 5.6 or 5.7g.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Aergrind - \~$120 [cosmetic 2nd](http://www.madebyknock.com/store/p39/Aergrind.html) from MBK website for 97 GBP \~= $122 USD (stock runs out fast on this).  Or Prima coffee sometimes has stock on new and used aergrinds, but is more expensive.

Aergrind is probably the best grinder you can get that fits inside the plunger of an aeropress.  It does stick out a bit but saves room.  I do not use the funnel for the aeropress.  I weigh the beans into the catch cup and it's small enough so there's no spilling.  You can also get a porlex mini or a rhino compact, both will fit in the plunger as well and the rhino has an adapter to grind directly into the aeropress.  I will likely keep my Lido ET and use it when I have more space, ie camping or car traveling.

&amp;#x200B;

I should also note that the lid of the kettle opens up as wide as the kettle is and there's additional room in there for storage.  Probably can fit in 1 16oz ""fat"" bag of coffee.  The ""tall skinny"" type of bags would be too tall, but you can fold it.

&amp;#x200B;

However this morning I stumbled across the De'Longhi DEDICA EC 685.BK Espresso Machine which I've seen online for around £150-£200. I haven't seen this machine spoken about anywhere but it has fantastic reviews. I'm sure there are plenty of reasons why this isn't a good machine so I was hoping you might be able to shed some light on why this is so cheap and why I would be wasting my money by trying to make Espresso with it.

And also a question. I'll start with the question

1. Have you experienced that there is an ideal brewed volume for a brewing device? Specifically, I'm using a V60, 02. Been brewing for couple years, and as I'm usually the only coffee drinker in the house, I usually just brew anywhere from 15-20 grams of coffee. However, using the method below as recommended by my local shop, I brew 25 grams. They use a 1:15 ratio (375g of water). And... not sure if its the recipe itself, or the volume, but my cups have been noticeably improved and consistently delicious. I guess I'll try this next...but I would think that theoretically, if I only used 12 grams, appropriately tightened my grind size, and otherwise used the same method that I could get the same cup. But maybe a particular volume will intrinsically lead to a better brew? Just curious your experience regarding the best brew volume for the V60, 02 size.

And then for anyone curious, I've really been obtaining consistently tasty coffee with the following. (same method used by my favorite local coffee shop):

\- So its essentially the [Rao method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0Qe_ASxfNM), with some minor differences.

\-Using a V60 02, Comandante grinder (usually between 23 and 25 clicks), Third wave water  \*(one packet per two gallons), @ 208 degrees F

1. Using a 1:15 ratio. 25g coffee, 375g water.
2. Bloom 4x the water weight with 100 grams within 15 seconds or so
3. Stir the slurry. Just like my local shop, I use a fairly large wooden spoon and gently move the grounds back and forth 4x north/south, then 4x east/west (okay not EXACTLY those cardinal directions, but you get the idea). In the past, I'd use a small spoon and kind of erratically stir. Really don't know if switching to a larger spoon and being more gentle changes anything...but as mentioned...brews have been great.
4. After 45 seconds, single pour the rest, up to 375g. Circles and zig-zags, just with a consistent pour rate. Finish this by around 1:30. Nearly fills the whole thing up
5. Gently spin to help achieve a flat bed
6. Finishes anywhere between 2:50 and 4 mins depending on the bean

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway...sometimes achieving a good pour over can be frustrating. Just a few things I've found that have made a difference. I now consistently prefer my V60 to my Kalita wave. And I had that pretty well dialed in using the [George Howell method](http://www.georgehowellcoffee.com/brew-guide/kalita-185/). Perhaps, as some suggested by some on this sub, all this fussing over the pour routine is a lot of sound and fury with little meaning...but its what is working for me at the moment. Give it a shot!

As such, I’m starting the process of researching new gear (mainly grinders) as my current grinder, an original Baratza Sette 270W, produces a lot of fines and boulders on its coarsest setting (based on using a Kruve to dial in), and very few grounds in the sweet spot. It’s definitely doable and usable due to cold brews forgiving nature but grinding coarse is not what the Sette 270 is intended for. 

Being that the Forte BG is a commercial rated grinder and I know it would be a bit overkill for the few times a month that I’d need to use it to grind up a week's worth of cold brew at a time, but I’m ok with that. After selling my current gear, I figure my budget would be in the $1,000 range so I’d like to invest in the best equipment I can afford. 

So that’s my question, **is the Forte BG the best sub-$1,000 grinder you’d recommend for grinding coarse &amp; medium-coarse coffee for cold brew?**

Thanks in advance for any advice or tips you wish to share! :)

*Edit: Some additional details that may help explain our desire for a BG or similar high-end solution:* 

* After brewing our cold (immersion) brew coffee, we filter it through a Chemex filter; however, due to the extreme amount of fines from the Sette, that filtering process takes over 30 minutes (I could swap out multiple filters part of the way through, but that feels like a big waste). I'm hoping a more appropriate grinder, like the BG, would help significantly in this area as well, in addition to getting us closer to a slow-drip flavor profile.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have had to switch from espresso to cold brew (both immersion and slow drip) due to our stomachs no longer being able to handle what I’m guessing is the acidity in other brew methods.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm curious if anyone using this or a similar model for a 1.5 gallon volume output? Our batch settings for the .5 gallon are fine for air pots but we are getting a water overflow coming over the basket within the brewer for the larger (1.5 gal) output. It doesn't seem to extract fast enough. 

Before the machine decided to do a factory reset the settings were fine when we leased it off our local Fetco provider. We are trying to track him down and get his settings but for now, does anyone have their settings for 1.5 gallon yield?  Or can anyone figure out what we have incorrect on our settings?

We are using appropriately sized Bun brand filters with 365g of coffee ground.

We have tried anything from 3% to 7% prewet volume with a 1:00 prewet delay. A 10% bypass and a brew time of 5 minutes.

We've gone from having it overflow at 45 seconds to now it overflows at about 1:45. 

Any thoughts or standard settings we should be using for a 1.5 gallon output? We've been shooting from the hip for a lot of this. While I'm learning a LOT, we still can't get coffee to come out :)

Thank you!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Y&amp;#39;all. I&amp;#39;m curious if anyone using this or a similar model for a 1.5 gallon volume output? Our batch settings for the .5 gallon are fine for air pots but we are getting a water overflow coming over the basket within the brewer for the larger (1.5 gal) output. It doesn&amp;#39;t seem to extract fast enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the machine decided to do a factory reset the settings were fine when we leased it off our local Fetco provider. We are trying to track him down and get his settings but for now, does anyone have their settings for 1.5 gallon yield?  Or can anyone figure out what we have incorrect on our settings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using appropriately sized Bun brand filters with 365g of coffee ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have tried anything from 3% to 7% prewet volume with a 1:00 prewet delay. A 10% bypass and a brew time of 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve gone from having it overflow at 45 seconds to now it overflows at about 1:45. &lt;/p&gt;

*Now on to my question:*

At my house the boiling point of water is 100 C (212 F) but currently I'm on a business trip on another island (the country is an archipelago) , I brought my coffee gear with me and due to the different altitude, the boiling point seems to have become 92-94 C (197 to 201 F) which is a good temperature, I seemed to have gotten lucky because all my coffees are great with this temperature.

&amp;#x200B;

However what if I have a certain coffee that required a higher temperature than 92-94 C (197 to 201 F)? How do baristas manage to raise the temperature even higher aside from simply travelling to a lower altitude? Do we have no choice but to adjust another variable instead like the grind level or dose?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi I&amp;#39;m a relatively new coffee lover from the Philippines and I mainly use my V60 to brew my coffees, almost every day.

Good afternoon and happy weekend r/Coffee!

Edit:budget is $600 absolute max, would prefer closer to $400

&amp;#x200B;

I have been brewing pour overs and on the Aeropress for 5 years now on my Lido 2. This thing is still putting out fantastic grind quality and cups. It is a true workhorse and I could not recommend the Lidos for home use enough. With that said it has taken quite a beating over the years, so I am thinking about retiring the grinder to my cousin as she gets into coffee. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not as versed in grinders as I used to be so I'd love to hear some recommendations from the community. As I mentioned before, I mostly brew pour overs (90% v60) and on the Aeropress. The quality has to be that of the Lido and other high-quality hand grinders. I might be interested in diving into an espresso machine someday as I have a decent paying job now, so if there is a machine that can do both drip and espresso that would be ideal.

As I mentioned before, I mostly brew pour overs (90% v60) and on the Aeropress. The quality has to be that of the Lido and other high-quality hand grinders. I might be interested in diving into an espresso machine someday as I have a decent paying job now, so if there is a machine that can do both drip and espresso that would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks guys :)&lt;/p&gt;

I quickly stopped backflushing, removed the portafilter, and tried to run water through the group head. I got the same pump noise and no water flow.

Now every time I turn on the machine the pump turns on and runs continuously, but the boiler does not turn on (no light for it). The pump is not starved - water is flowing out of the return tubing back into the reservoir at what I would call a normal rate. The low water detection switch seems to work - if I lift the reservoir up I hear that switch click and the machine stops and starts beeping, thinking the tank is empty.

I can open the group head, the hot water tap, and the steam wand and no water flows through any of the three despite the pump running.

The steam &amp; pressure gauge shows zero bars while the pump is running (and, of course, when they are not).

I've googled around about this but people seem to have different symptoms - they seem to get water running through the group head. 

I can take the machine apart - I replaced the pressure stat before. However, the exploded parts diagram for the machine is in Italian, so many of the parts are a bit mysterious to me.

Is it that espresso grinders can only be used for finer grinds only? This is my first coffee grinder ever and have no clue if the coarse grouds it produces are acceptable or not for a grinder of this type. Thanks.

I am not an owner of a coffee shop nor a coffee roaster, although I want to learn. I am just a barista who is really interested in learning more about coffee.

Today my question is about the coffee labels and overall about the new trend in coffee. I have seen that these days premium coffee that comes from micro plantations are labeled with the name of their plantation, the altitude, and the processing method, a trend that seems to follow a special etiquette like wine. It all seems to make sense at first because people are becoming more and more demanding in terms of quality and coffee is not an exception. But, as I was speaking to the owner of the cafe that I work in, he told me that most of those ""fancy"" new coffee labels we see are fake because it is nearly impossible to get so much from a single farm. All of the micro-plantations do not have enough supply to meet all the demand they are facing. I may be overstepping my thoughts in here, but it makes total sense if we think about the whole supply and demand rules. Those farms or plantations that are owned by local people just cannot be as big or as resourceful as the ones owned by the big corporations, hence the big lie in production. I doubt that local roasteries owning 4\~6 coffee shops in a city can produce the same coffee from the same plantation all year. What I was told it makes sense is that they can have their coffee from the same REGION but not just from only one provider. So it is more accurate to say what region is the coffee from instead just saying that comes from a single plantation? Are all the coffee consumers being lied???

&lt;p&gt;To cut to the chase: We’re closing down Kalita USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was just about to buy the Kalita Wave 185 to try the pour over method but now I&amp;#39;m worried about the future availability of the proprietary filters. The V60 seemed a little more appealing to me anyway, even though it seems like the learning curve will be steeper. I&amp;#39;ll probably buy one this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

A follow up for my [coffee journey so far](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/bulezn/after_experimenting_with_different_ways_to_make/).  Most the grinders are fairly new, so there could be inconsistencies caused by not breaking in the burrs, but I don't know.

I did not do any taste tests as I still have a fairly hard time differentiating between coffee flavors and when I tried doing taste tests, I very quickly go ""taste blind.""  So this is mainly to just report on the grind consistency.  I also haven't spent very much time dialing in for taste nor have I been keeping journals on when I made good coffee vs bad coffee.  I mainly just picked a recipe/grind size that I thought would work, and kept it at that.  I do notice taste differences between the grinders, but that might be due to different grind sizes.

&amp;#x200B;

====&gt; The settings I used for the grinders were arbitrary.  I did not align the settings among the different grinders to match grind sizes, I just picked some arbitrary settings that I believe represented the full grind range of said grinder.  &lt;====

&amp;#x200B;

[Beans](https://imgur.com/a/6TNcahg) \- Some of my own home roasted Ethiopia Agaro Nano Challa Coop from Sweet Maria's.  Roasted 30s after FC with bread machine heatgun 1lb roast =&gt; 12oz output in 14 min.

&amp;#x200B;

[Hario Mini Mill](https://imgur.com/a/bxkRXbb) \- Bought new, not broken in, less than 2 lb grounded.  There is a lot of play on the dial so expect lots of burr movement at each setting.  0 clicks was the tightest I could set it.  2 clicks is very fine, probably espresso fine, but you'll never be able to dial it in and it was super super slow.  It already starts to get very inconsistent at 5 clicks and even more so at 9 clicks, so the step sizes are very very large.  It should be a good starting point for most people, would not recommend for daily use due to speed, could be a cheap compact travel grinder.  V60 pourovers got clogged at the end at setting 6.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lido ET](https://imgur.com/a/90qjPbO) \- Bought new, not broken in, less than 2 lb grounded.  Burrs touch at 0:-1 (0 full rotations and -1 marks from the alignment ""0"" marker).  1:8 means 1 full rotation on the dial and +8 marks.  There are 16 marks per full rotation.  The full range of the ET is supposed to be around 4 full rotations, but at 2 rotations it is already very coarse.  You can clearly see that it is much better than the Hario Mini Mill.  The espresso range on this is stated to be 0:4 to 0:8.  V60 pourovers at 1:4 did not have any clogging.  It made very good coffee and can well be your daily driver for espresso (i never used it for espresso though) and brew.  It can also be a large travel grinder too, if you have room.  Possibility an ""end all"" for all coffee brewing methods.

&amp;#x200B;

[Baratza Encore](https://imgur.com/a/27jZZBF) \- Bought new, not broken in, less than 5 lbs grounded, stock no M2 upgrade.  The burrs started singing for me around setting 5.  At setting 8 it was still very fine.  As a lot of people state, at coarser settings, this produces very inconsistent results and I agree.  I would say that this produces fairly good results &lt;24.  It is not as consistent as the lido across all grind ranges, but it does a good enough job.  I got a small amount of clogging at setting 18 for pourovers.  Most people would probably be satisfied with this grinder for non espresso use for a looong time.  I heard the M2 burr upgrade will help with the fines at all settings.  Though the M2 bottom burr + top burr puts it close the a refurb virtuoso, and I would just recommend spending a little extra and buy that instead.

&amp;#x200B;

[Baratza Sette 270](https://imgur.com/a/9HH96Qx) \- Bought refurb from baratza, standard AP burr.  Probably 5lbs or so through it.  This is straight up an espresso grinder.  Anything coarser than espresso is going to have too many fines.  At 18C you get into the pourover range, but it is inferior to the Encore and Lido already at this point.  I did not do any pourovers with this.  Could be your ""end all"" espresso grinder.  From what I've researched on the BG burr, is that it'll probably put it on par with the encore but changing out the burr is a bit troublesome unless you also bought another adjustment ring.  I would just recommend buying a separate grinder for brew.

&amp;#x200B;

[Grindmaster 875](https://imgur.com/a/aNIPvNT) \- Got this on a whim to play around with for cheap.  It is likely from a starbucks store and has seen tons of use.  The burrs looked in good condition, but I could not tell if they were worn.  I cleaned it out best I could and aligned the turkish to when the burrs just started to sing.  Even on the turkish setting it was pretty coarse.  I would say this is straight up a brew grinder.  It produces pretty good results across all the grind ranges.  I have not made any coffee from this.  I got it mainly to grind my self roasted beans to give to friends who do not have grinders.  I hear people using smaller bulk grinders for pourover, it does a great job, but the retention, size, and mess it makes doesn't make it ideal.

&amp;#x200B;

Aergrind - I have this on order for portable travel use since the Lido is a beast to carry around and the Hario isn't very good.  So no testing results on this yet.  Initial thoughts just from research is that, it'll probably work well as a daily driver and travel grinder.  Just be annoyed when grinding the 35g aeropress world championship recipes or larger batches.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, if I were to just do this again and without the wife wanting lattes factor, and it turns only she only wants maybe one a week, if that...  I would just get an aeropress and encore for home use, and throw in an aergrind or mini mill for travel.  And if wife wants a latte, just get a standalone milk frother.  I'm just not that into espresso right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my summary of different brewing methods.

Pour overs - makes great coffee, but pouring it is a pain in the ass, can be hard to get consistent.

Espresso/Americano - Other people take up to 5-10 min to do a shot, I got mine down under a min and half now including cleanup.  Super fast, super quick, just expensive for the machine and grinder.

Aeropress - Best of both worlds, cheap and quick, it's not annoying to do at all.  Simple clean up too.

Drip - Can't find a single cup brewing machine, moccamaster might work, but don't wanna buy one and hate it.  Larger good brewers are bulky and not ideal for single cups.

&amp;#x200B;

And also, don't spend tons of time doing research.  The more research you do, the more you think that your perfectly capable ""entry level"" grinder is ""just not good enough"".  I'm almost slipping into the rat hole of wanting to get a niche for espresso and OE apex or fuji royal for pourover.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my take on grinder tests.

It already starts to get very inconsistent at 5 clicks and even more so at 9 clicks, so the step sizes are very very large.  It should be a good starting point for most people, would not recommend for daily use due to speed, could be a cheap compact travel grinder.  V60 pourovers got clogged at the end at setting 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/90qjPbO""&gt;Lido ET&lt;/a&gt; - Bought new, not broken in, less than 2 lb grounded.  Burrs touch at 0:-1 (0 full rotations and -1 marks from the alignment &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; marker).  1:8 means 1 full rotation on the dial and +8 marks.  There are 16 marks per full rotation.  The full range of the ET is supposed to be around 4 full rotations, but at 2 rotations it is already very coarse.  You can clearly see that it is much better than the Hario Mini Mill.  The espresso range on this is stated to be 0:4 to 0:8.  V60 pourovers at 1:4 did not have any clogging.  It made very good coffee and can well be your daily driver for espresso (i never used it for espresso though) and brew.  It can also be a large travel grinder too, if you have room.  Possibility an &amp;quot;end all&amp;quot; for all coffee brewing methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/27jZZBF""&gt;Baratza Encore&lt;/a&gt; - Bought new, not broken in, less than 5 lbs grounded, stock no M2 upgrade.  The burrs started singing for me around setting 5.  At setting 8 it was still very fine.  As a lot of people state, at coarser settings, this produces very inconsistent results and I agree.  I would say that this produces fairly good results &amp;lt;24.  It is not as consistent as the lido across all grind ranges, but it does a good enough job.  I got a small amount of clogging at setting 18 for pourovers.  Most people would probably be satisfied with this grinder for non espresso use for a looong time.  I heard the M2 burr upgrade will help with the fines at all settings.  Though the M2 bottom burr + top burr puts it close the a refurb virtuoso, and I would just recommend spending a little extra and buy that instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/9HH96Qx""&gt;Baratza Sette 270&lt;/a&gt; - Bought refurb from baratza, standard AP burr.  Probably 5lbs or so through it.  This is straight up an espresso grinder.  Anything coarser than espresso is going to have too many fines.  At 18C you get into the pourover range, but it is inferior to the Encore and Lido already at this point.  I did not do any pourovers with this.  Could be your &amp;quot;end all&amp;quot; espresso grinder.  From what I&amp;#39;ve researched on the BG burr, is that it&amp;#39;ll probably put it on par with the encore but changing out the burr is a bit troublesome unless you also bought another adjustment ring.  I would just recommend buying a separate grinder for brew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/aNIPvNT""&gt;Grindmaster 875&lt;/a&gt; - Got this on a whim to play around with for cheap.  It is likely from a starbucks store and has seen tons of use.  The burrs looked in good condition, but I could not tell if they were worn.  I cleaned it out best I could and aligned the turkish to when the burrs just started to sing.  Even on the turkish setting it was pretty coarse.  I would say this is straight up a brew grinder.  It produces pretty good results across all the grind ranges.  I have not made any coffee from this.  I got it mainly to grind my self roasted beans to give to friends who do not have grinders.  I hear people using smaller bulk grinders for pourover, it does a great job, but the retention, size, and mess it makes doesn&amp;#39;t make it ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aergrind - I have this on order for portable travel use since the Lido is a beast to carry around and the Hario isn&amp;#39;t very good.  So no testing results on this yet.  Initial thoughts just from research is that, it&amp;#39;ll probably work well as a daily driver and travel grinder.  Just be annoyed when grinding the 35g aeropress world championship recipes or larger batches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, if I were to just do this again and without the wife wanting lattes factor, and it turns only she only wants maybe one a week, if that...  I would just get an aeropress and encore for home use, and throw in an aergrind or mini mill for travel.  And if wife wants a latte, just get a standalone milk frother.  I&amp;#39;m just not that into espresso right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my summary of different brewing methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour overs - makes great coffee, but pouring it is a pain in the ass, can be hard to get consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espresso/Americano - Other people take up to 5-10 min to do a shot, I got mine down under a min and half now including cleanup.  Super fast, super quick, just expensive for the machine and grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aeropress - Best of both worlds, cheap and quick, it&amp;#39;s not annoying to do at all.  Simple clean up too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drip - Can&amp;#39;t find a single cup brewing machine, moccamaster might work, but don&amp;#39;t wanna buy one and hate it.  Larger good brewers are bulky and not ideal for single cups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also, don&amp;#39;t spend tons of time doing research.  The more research you do, the more you think that your perfectly capable &amp;quot;entry level&amp;quot; grinder is &amp;quot;just not good enough&amp;quot;.  I&amp;#39;m almost slipping into the rat hole of wanting to get a niche for espresso and OE apex or fuji royal for pourover.&lt;/p&gt;

How's your day?

It's nice to have a sub with so many people that enjoy filter coffee. However something I've noticed in posts of beginners that ask for advice or in posts that talk about different dripper types is that the design differences effect on brewing seems quite exaggerated and often explained in a rather bro science-y way.

So, I use Melitta style filters mostly. I've got drippers from a bunch of different companies in a bunch of different designs and here are some observations about things I read rather frequently on reddit.

1.) Drippers with one small hole will NOT restrict the flow. If you actually got the maximum throughput your cup would be filled in a matter of seconds. The limiting factors are the pour, the ground coffee and the paper filter.

2.) Different numbers of holes (I've had original Melittas with 1, 2, 3 and 4, Kalitas 101s and 102s, Ritzenhoff 3 and 4-hole and some noname plastic ones) don't really make a lot of difference either. Same reason given above.

3.) The ridges have practically no impact on the brew. In fact the new Melittas don't even have them in the upper half. Melittas paper filters are actually a bit too small to fit snug to the inside walls of the drippers on all sides and when there's a gap the coffee doesn't really ever come in contact with the ridges. The gaps don't fill up with liquid either, it stays in the paper filter.

4.) Material seems not very important. Yes, theoretically heat retention is a thing but as far as I'm concerned I can't tell a difference between brews with plastic and porcelain and metal.

It all happens inside the paper filter. The dripper itself contributes very little. It holds the filter, has a base so you can have it sit on a carafe or a cup safely  and makes it easy to throw away the coffee after the brewing is done. What else can it do?

How good the brew turns out comes down to adjusting the basic variables people here tell you about and practicing the brewing process. None of the filter holders, no matter how beautiful to look at, will sprinkle\* your coffee with fairy dust.

Brewed in Moka Pots usually.  Any way I also wanted to help the people of PR would have been hurt by the Hurricane.  So I bought a two pound bag of Gustos Cafe Premium. I&amp;#39;ll write what they say about it on the bag; Class; Specialty grade coffee selected from the best farmers in Puerto Rico, Process; Washed, Profile; Full body, low acid (I agree!), and great aroma (I agree!) for a balanced cup, Size; #17, Altitude 2000 feet, Roast: Medium (which is the preferred roast for my super auto ESAM3300), 100% Arabica.  As I stored in pint jars to vacuum seal I made note of the clean beans through out bag, no minced pieces, nothing but whole beans with next to not broken bean.  I am such a happy camper now!   Probably the first time I can say the smell of the bean duplicates the taste of the espresso.  The flavor comes through even if latte milk.&lt;/p&gt;

A bit of internet research taught me that there are 3 main glasses commonly used for this purpose. All  use toughened glass, and are around 13cl/4.4oz . I decided to buy them all, and in no particular order, here's how I got on:

&amp;#x200B;

1. [Duralex Picardie](https://www.duralex.com/picardie.html?lang=2): Depending on who you ask, this is 'the' Cortado glass. Virtually unchanged since the 1930s, this French design legend is such an iconic design you can even find it in design books and museums. Traditionally used for water and fruit juice, they are incredibly cheap to buy (in the UK I paid £6 for 6 of them on Amazon!), look fancier than you'd expect when cleaned up thanks to their neat fluted sides, are virtually unbreakable and are very ergonomic. The distinct narrow base and flared top have 2 distinct benefits for coffee. Firstly, they create a wide rim to help making latte art, which can be difficult on such a small drink. Secondly, the wider top is comfortable to hold with a finger and thumb, and balances nicely as you tip it to drink, which I prefer to having to hold the hot sides of the glass in full. The only downside is the tough Duralex glass isn't so great at holding heat. This isn't much of an issue with a drink as small as a Cortado, but it does mean you have to get a move on. A few marks also lost for the glass having a few... well, marks. Duralex glass is always heat tested so they're not likely to have cracks, but this is industrial glassware so there are little imperfections if you hold them to the light. Crystal glassware this is not - but to me that's part of the charm.

Here are some of my attempts using this glass: [1](https://i.imgur.com/EcEp0ue.jpg) [2](https://i.imgur.com/TvXO3R2.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

2. [Duralex Provence](https://www.duralex.com/provence.html?lang=2): Another classic from Duralex, often used in cafes serving Cortados, this is actually a slightly more recent design than the Picardie, but arguable more ubiquitious and certainly more copied nowadays. The more conventional sides are more vertical compared to the Picardie, meaning the benefits of the Picardie are somewhat lost, but some people prefer this aesthetic. Everything else is the same as Picardie, including the cost.

My best effort in this so far: [1](https://i.imgur.com/E5QIckb.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

3. [Libby Gibraltar Glass:](https://www.cortadoglass.com/) Made in the USA from patented 'Duratuff' glass, the Libby Glass Company's Gibraltar glass was made famous for Cortados by its use at Bluebottle Coffee, and remains in my opinion the ultimate way to enjoy this drink. I had to pay over £8 for a single glass, but I could tell immediately upon opening it that I'll have this forever. This thing is BUILT! It's reassuringly heavy, and manages to be extremely thick whilst having almost crystal glass level cut and clarity. It's beautiful to look at. The thick base means no saucer or coaster is required to protect surfaces from the heat, it stays hot for an amazing amount of time (even after you finish the drink), and it's a very balanced cup to drink from at pivot point. It's often used for spirits, but it's great for coffee due to not just the aforementioned thermal properties, but also because the rounded internal base means coffee and milk pour into it beautifully. It actually made pouring latte art incredibly easy, and almost accidental. The only downside is the cost. This thing is absolutely frigging perfect.

I further noticed that said gap looked kind of brownish when turned up into the light, so I started to pick at it with the hairs of the flux brush I was using to dust out the bottom burr and the grind chute/bin.

Thing was, tho, that the wimpy hairs on the flux brush couldn't really do anything but dust the front of that gap. As soon as I started using a Go-Between on it (after having tried the tip of a small boning knife with no real success), I started excavating different sizes of coffee grounds, some like specks of dust, others more like table salt or even castor sugar. And I kept unearthing more of the damned things every time I tapped the back of the burr against a mouse pad. I spent a good 10 minutes digging the head of the Go-Between into that gap before I could spin the whole thing freely around in the space between the burr and burr plate and no more grounds were falling out.

I had the burr off for a quick clean up and blow out when I noticed this gap that runs around the inside perimeter of the burr; it&amp;#39;s a gap between the burr itself and the plate that it&amp;#39;s screwed onto. I further noticed that said gap looked kind of brownish when turned up into the light, so I started to pick at it with the hairs of the flux brush I was using to dust out the bottom burr and the grind chute/bin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thing was, tho, that the wimpy hairs on the flux brush couldn&amp;#39;t really do anything but dust the front of that gap. As soon as I started using a Go-Between on it (after having tried the tip of a small boning knife with no real success), I started excavating different sizes of coffee grounds, some like specks of dust, others more like table salt or even castor sugar. And I kept unearthing more of the damned things every time I tapped the back of the burr against a mouse pad. I spent a good 10 minutes digging the head of the Go-Between into that gap before I could spin the whole thing freely around in the space between the burr and burr plate and no more grounds were falling out.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently he uses already ground coffee (I think illy?) in a moka pot, but I know he would like to buy a true espresso machine eventually (maybe an item for that wedding registry)

Based on the wiki I think I should be looking at the Baratza encore, but I was wondering if it would make any sense to get him the stepless espresso grinder now so he doesn’t have to buy a new one when he graduates to the machine. 

Would the Baratza Sette 270 be good for a moka pot too? I imagine if it can grind something fine enough for espresso it can still grind coarse enough for the moka pot? However he’s also mentioned that usually an espresso machine will come with a grinder built in, so will the Sette be obsolete before it’s even needed for espresso?

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for a good hand grinder/ electric kettle for brewing coffee on my aeropress in the office and also for any trips I go on. My office doesn't have a stove, only has a water filter system that spews out water at a temperature that isn't hot enough for what I need it to be (180 degrees+). Any recommendations for electric kettles that have a temperature gauge?

As for the grinder, well I have a Baratza Encore at home (not upgraded), which is fine for me as my primary grinder. Just need something that is portable.

I was looking at the Lido-2 as a possible one as I read many good things about it, but it appears that people say it is quite heavy and that would defeat the purpose of carrying around every day.

Another option I see mentioned a lot here is the Aergrind, which might make the most sense for me since I'll be using my aeropress.

Last year in Tokyo I had a cup from About Life, and ever since I've been trying to recreate what I tasted there. 

I initially had very little luck. The recipes one finds online vary wildly. A lot of times my brews were coming out dull and flat; it wasn't vibrant or fruity like the cup I had in Tokyo. 

I recently found James Hoffmann's [iced pourover recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PApBycDrPo0), which *finally* helped me make some seriously great coffee. If you are having trouble with iced filter coffee, watch that video. I've tweaked the recipe a bit, and I thought I'd share here. I'd love to hear how everybody else brews their iced coffee.

**Setup**

Hario V60 w/ bleached filter

Baratza Virtuoso

Pitcher with at least 500ml capacity. 

**Coffee, Water, and Ice**

I'm following Hoffmann's suggestion to increase the amount of coffee per liter of water. Hoffmann usually recommends 60g of coffee per 1l of water, but for iced coffee he bumps this up to 65g per 1l of water. I go slightly higher: 70g per 1l. Since I'm brewing 500ml at a time, I use 35g.

A note about beans: beans with tasting notes like maple syrup or green apple tend to produce the best results for me. I think a sweet roast can really shine in iced filter coffee. Obviously this is can vary based on your personal preferences.

Hoffmann recommends 40% ice and 60% water as a baseline. My freezer runs a bit cold, so I use slightly less ice in order to ensure all the ice in the pitcher melts during the brew. I like to use 170g ice and 330g water.

**Recipe**

Grind coffee a bit finer than you would for a normal V60 brew. On my Virtuoso I usually have it set to 16, though sometimes 18 depending on the beans. (My usual range for a V60 is 18-20.)

Heat water to 92C.

Preheat V60 and rinse filter. Do not preheat your pitcher.

With 170g of ice in the pitcher, start your brew. I aim for a long bloom, about 1 minute, using a 2:1 water to coffee ratio to start.

Slowly pour the rest of the water. Hoffmann recommends that your brew time should be around 3 minutes, and that's where I've had the most success. 

Hoffmann recommends stirring the grounds, but I've found that with a very slow, deliberate, and consistent pour stirring doesn't make much difference. Again, this could be mostly a personal preference.

By the end of your brew, all the ice in your pitcher should have melted. If it is not all melting, you can decrease the amount of ice in future brews. The goal seems to be to minimize the amount of ice you use while also making sure the coffee comes out cold.

Serve in cool glass with ice. Enjoy!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, a Japanese-style iced filter coffee is probably my favorite way to drink coffee.

It honestly works with most types of beans, too, which is the awesome part. This is an inverted aeropress recipe


Tools: Fellow Kettle, Hario Skerkon pro, Hario scale, aeropress, standard aeropress filters, and a bamboo chopstick. 


Materials: 34g coffee beans, 270g filtered water total. 


- Using the Skerkon Pro adjust it 7 “clicks” in from tight, crush the 34g of beans put it in the aeropress. Pre-wet the filter now and let it cool. (I Rest mine on my unheated cup while I do the rest)


- add 150g water at 90c  to the 34g of coffee  in the inverted aeropress over 30 seconds (shut off kettle at this time)


- stir with bamboo chopstick semi-roughly for 30 seconds


- put on the filter cap and flip it to your unheated cup and press for 30 seconds (I really put my back into it at the end to get them oils out)


-add 120g of water from the kettle.

Been drinking kcups for a year or two and always added milk or creamer.  

Got an espresso machine two months ago bc wife wants lattes.  Barista express.  

After drinking lattes daily for a week, my body revolted against the lactose, always have been mildly lactose intolerant and just put my body into stock.  Hated all milk substitutes and just settled on americanos which I now prefer.  

Sold the bbe and got a silvia for cheap.  Liked the silvia but hated the water wand.  Then sold the silvia and found a dual boiler for a good deal.  It's a great machine.  I still suck at latte art.  Wife was blaming me for steaming milk then pulling the shot, but now I can do both and still suck at it.  She thought it would be easy, but she sucks at latte art too.  

Sometime in between I also messed around with a french press since I was just drinking americanos now.  I followed James hoffman's french press method but never was able to get it to taste good.  So I just gave up and stuck to americanos.  I also tried the v60 but hated the process of doing the pour.  It did make good coffee though.  

Now I got an aeropress and absolutely love it.  It's much faster and easier to clean up.  I use the inverted method with 16g grounds and boom with 40g water and stir vigorously for 20s.  Then fill it all the way to the top (about 250g water used) wait until 1:30 and press until 2:00.  Makes about 230g in the cup.  

Oh yeah and for grinder, I got a hario mini mill, encore, lido et, sette 270, and an aergrind on the way for travel.  

The hario mini mill is a but uneven but still does well enough, slow though.  The encore is great if you stay out of the coarse range.  The sette 270 works great for Expresso but has too many fines outside of espresso.  The lido is very consistent in all grind ranges but its huge.  

For home use an encore is good enough and for travel, probably the aergrind though I havent actually used it yet.  

So good coffee doesnt have to be expensive.  The most important factor are good beans.  I also roast my own and buy others just so I have a metric to compare again.  I think I've got the hang of tasting different flavors now.  Theres worlds of difference between something freshly roasted and a couple months old.  All the highly commercalized stuff just tastes bitter and has the ""coffee"" flavor with light, medium, dark describing the strength.  Not very good stuff.  

So my recommendation is an aeropress with encore for home use.  For travel, pair it up with a 0.5L kettle, aergrind, or even porlex mini or hario mini mill (but the hario doesnt fit in the plunger)  The included tote bag is great for carrying it all and a small scale plus beans minus the kettle.  No need for the funnel and scoop.    

I'll do a post regarding the travel setup once I have all the pieces but I was using the lido e t, v60, 1.7L kettle and it took up over half my carry on.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My story. &lt;/p&gt;

**COFFEE TIP OF THE DAY!!**

Today’s tip comes from  Jonathan Gagné, astrophysicist, coffee blogger (coffeeadastra.com/blog),  and all-around nice Canadian: Oxygen-absorbing pads are an  inexpensive way to keep a bag of coffee fresh. A pack of 100 pads with  100cc of absorption potential costs about $20 USD. 100cc means  that a single pad will absorb 100 cubic centimeters of oxygen at sea  level atmospheric pressure. This will keep about a pound of dry material  sealed free of oxygen if you do not open it. In other words, a single  pad will be enough to keep a properly sealed 12oz bag of coffee free of  oxygen for months or dozens of openings. This will cost you 20 cents per  bag of coffee and will make the coffee last much longer before it  tastes old. Oxygen absorption pads always come vac-sealed when  you buy them, otherwise they would arrive completely spent. You will  need to store them in a sealed zip-lock bag after opening the original  packaging. Just open the zip-lock and take one out whenever you need it,  then remove as much air as you can from the zip-lock and close it. You  do not need to rush when you are manipulating the oxygen pads; they  won’t get spent in just a few minutes if you let them out of a bag.  However, not closing your zip-lock of oxygen pads properly will get them  spent much faster than you want.

You can tell when an oxygen pad  is spent by feeling its texture through its plastic enclosure;   initially it has the texture of very small crystals like sand, but  becomes clumped into a hardened loaf when completely spent.When I  receive a bag of coffee from a roaster, I always break out an oxygen  pad and place it inside. If the roaster’s bag does not come with a  one-way valve and a zip-lock enclosure, I place it in a bag that does  have both these features with its oxygen pad. I even like to place an  oxygen pad inside vacuum sealed bags to make sure that there is no  oxygen left in it, especially when I vac-seal whole beans for long-term  storage in the freezer - there is always empty space in between whole  beans, and a small amount of oxygen could be trapped in that space even  after vac sealing","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copying the text from Scott Rao&amp;#39;s Instagram page.

I am trying to get more into coffee and sensory. I am wondering, what has the most influence of coffee taste?

* Variety (type)
* Process (wet, natural)

I taste differences for different coffees, but I find it quite hard to get a grip on that.  E.g. an Ethiopian arabica, washed, medium dark roast tastes different compared to a Brasilian arabica, natural, light roasted - what makes the difference? 

Sometimes I try new coffees at the shops and I like them, but I am not really sure what I like from the above-mentioned factors. Of course its the combination of all factors, but is there anything really ""leading"" in the taste? And if we go away from single origin to blends, it makes it even more complicated, right? :)

I have recently found out that, yes, I do function better with a certain amount of caffeine in my system.  Traditionally, I've gone to energy drinks and high-caffeine sodas (loved Jolt since I was eight).  However, I am poor, and it's cheaper to make coffee than to buy soda.  It's also better for me.

I've got my eye set on a simple burr grinder and, for winter (very cold on the Great Lakes), a small stainless stovetop percolator.  Both are highly rated on either Amazon or Ebay.  I don't like drip coffee much, and my wife hates the stuff, so a small drip machine is out.  (She's a supertaster.  Even the mildest coffee is too bitter for her.)  I may even have a single-cup drip brewer somewhere.  My bladed grinder is used for spices. 

I know I need coarse and extra coarse grind for cold brew and percolator.  I mostly have questions about roast, cold brew, and steep time.  Without further rambling....

1.  What is a reasonable steep time for cold brew?

2.  What is the best low-cost option for a steeping container?  I'm disabled and on a fixed income, so ""inexpensive"" is the key word throughout.

3.  Do I need to put a filter on my kitchen tap to get good coffee?

4.  What are the benefits and detriments of different roasts, and what is most likely to create a light, fruity flavor?

5.  What happens when you steep green coffee beans?  (I ate one once, and it wasn't bad.)

A couple weeks ago I posted asking about what type of machine to get to make shots for my wife to make her ""venti quad"" starbucks drinks.  After a lot of feedback and comments, I couldn't swallow the $1000-$2000 pill right now for a nice super automatic (what my wife wants) or a separate machine/grinder combo.

&amp;#x200B;

So as I had a return at Target that would give me a gift card, I found a Breville Essenza Mini bundle.  ([link for those who care](https://www.target.com/p/nespresso-essenza-mini-bundle-black/-/A-52563314))

It was marked at $199, but for some reason had an old sales sticker on the bottom at $135.  I figured they wouldn't honor it since it's not on sale now, but sure enough the guy at customer service did accept it.

&amp;#x200B;

So after my return it only cost me $10.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been making Cappuccino's all morning (a few too many to be honest) and I really like it.  I wish the coffee came out hotter, but it's adequate.  Easy of use and cleanup is simple.  The Milk frother seems good (enough) and makes a nice creamy milk with foam.

Here is my recipe (I urge you to at least give it a try):

Blend the mix 
*optional cinnamon topping

My parents recently decided to break their Starbucks habit and start making coffee at home. They mostly drink coffee as part of their morning routine, as opposed to for the appreciation of the coffee itself. They rarely visit nice cafes and typically take their coffee with a hefty dose of milk. 

I would like to get them a nice setup to meet their needs and was hoping to get your advice on it. The main goals and constraints are:

1. Ideally automatic (though not necessarily on a timer). I am not sure if they’ll be willing to consistently make coffee manually (French press and the like?), but open to those suggestions. 

2. They would like to use whole beans, so presumably will need a grinder. 

3. They don’t currently drink espressos, and are probably happy with sticking to regular coffee. My understanding is that if you want to get into nice espressos, the budget increases dramatically. If there’s an option that is mainly aimed at regular coffee but can also let them dabble in okay-ish espressos, that would be awesome.

4. Fancier drinks like cappuccinos are not something they’ve been into before but would like to try making at home, if the equipment allows. 

5. The budget is around $750 CAD, though can be flexible if there’s a good reason to move up from there. 

All opinions are appreciated! Thanks all.

So been drinking coffee for years. Love it. It's great. It's why we're here and I just got here myself. 

I'm using a perculator now and testing out a bunch of different beans and roast profiles etc. Just trying to figure out what I like. My question is simple, what's the best brew method?

I've brought it down to three. Just need a nice, concise debate amongst the community on where to put my money. Id rather not buy 3-4 different methods over the next year and only use one of them. I tend to do this a lot with all of my other hobbies. 

So, here's what I got:

1. A nice size French press 
2. An Aeropress 
3. A pour over (Leaning towards a chemex or something I can brew more than 1-2 cups)

And if I'm missing anything, definitely would like to hear any other methods / options. Reddit has helped me into so many other ventures and I bet this forum will do that again for me. 

Thanks everyone in advance! Looking forward to learning new things.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone &lt;/p&gt;

Right between the 5 and 6 second mark it begins pouring.  If I increase the dose or lower the grind size it doesn&amp;#39;t change at all.  I use a calibrated tamper, so the tamp is very consistent every shot.  Additionally, from moment the timer starts, it takes 30 seconds to pull a double.  The shot tastes good, but I feel like I need to get this right to get the beans&amp;#39; full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

Hey, I almost feel kind of stupid asking something like this but Im actually very curious how other (coffee-)people think about this, so..

&amp;#x200B;

Im currently (re-)writing my curriculum vitae and just got to the ""hobbies part"". While listing them I also thought about listing my passion for coffee which I never actually did before. Probably because I didnt think of it as a common hobby. But thinking more about it out of all of my hobbies, ""coffee"" is one of those that Im most passionate about (and also spent the most time with)

&amp;#x200B;

Would you mention it? If so, how do you call it? Just ""Coffee""? Or would you leave it out? If so, why? Im pretty sure most people (employers) wont understand exactly what you mean with ""coffee"" as a hobby - which may be good actually? Or worst scenario they dont see it as something that would qualify as a ""hobby"" because it is 'just' coffee, a hot drink in the morning to wake up and you overvalue it or something

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to decide on what gadget to get to help me have the same and/or better experience at home. I'm a big fan of their Starbucks Double Shot on Ice which is essentially three shots of espresso on ice topped with a splash of cream.

I currently have an Aeropress and have used it a handful of times (using preground coffee) but can't seem to achieve the same experience. I'm looking for advice and guidance on how to emulate that taste using an Aeropress or if i should get an espresso machine instead

&amp;#x200B;

I bought it as an addition for my more hands on options (Kalita, Chemex, V60, Aeropress, French Press) and use it with my Baratza Encore.

&amp;#x200B;

To me, it's the ideal solution for lazy mornings when you just need a good coffee but can't be bothered with or aren't able yet to produce it with hand pour over. To me, the process feels very easy: Weigh out beans, grind them, rinse the filter, fill the water tank to the line, put a cup under it (yes, there have been mornings where I forgot it) and press the button. Walk away, come back for good coffee.

&amp;#x200B;

It produces 300ml at a time, but with weighing out water I've been able to achieve smaller cup sizes as well with good quality.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, it's only for people who trink ONE cup on a very regular base. If you want a machine to produce more cups, don't even look at it.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you need it? Does it make better coffee than hand pour over? No. But it makes good coffee and the convenience was worth it for me. I still love using my Kalita and French Press (or Chemex for guests) but would not want to miss the Moccamaster.

Why don’t the beans grind straight away where I marked it from?

Once I dial in on a single shot portafilter, and the coffee extracts nicely. All good.

I recently bought a Krupps Burr grinder and a Porlex manual grinder and some Presto coffee beans, I pretty much exclusively use a french press 3 cup that I put into a 290-300ml mug. What I soon realised and had previously thought was standard was that when using my normal coffee scoop, I’m coming in at around 10-12 grams of coffee per 290ml. That’s an increase as well as I recently changed my french press scoop and the old one was around 8-9g. I now realise that even 12g would be considered very weak for most people but after trying a cup with an 1:18 ratio it tasted way too strong for me. 

This morning I tried a cup at 290ml with 17grams of coffee in the french press ground to medium-coarse setting using the usual 4 minute french press technique and it was super strong.  I had already had 2 weaker cups of 12g coffees in the morning, so after trying the 17 gram coffee I got a caffeine headache with some mild visual issues like the start of a migraine when you have the colour flashes. 

Should I try and start drinking at a higher strength but having less cups per day? Or just stick to 12g per cup, I like the taste of my diluted coffee but I also feel like I’m missing out on something that could be much better.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

Sorry for the cheesy title, I couldn't help myself.

Anyways, about 3 months ago I started a sales job with crazy hours. I started turning to coffee to help get me up in the morning. Because of an experience long ago at a food awards ceremony, I knew that coffee was more than just Folgers.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my own grinder and a really cool drip machine that has a slower setting to get that bloom. I've been watching the subreddit for good bean recommendations and honestly you guys have never let me down. I also recently had a child and money has been very tight so when I ordered some Finca Inmaculada from Archetype coffee and it never arrived I was a little upset.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else had problems with Archetype? I made the order on 3/30/19 and I got an order confirmation and shipping confirmation. The tracking number shows a page that says the shipping label was created 4/1/19 but they are still awaiting the item.

&amp;#x200B;

They have no number to call, both their coffee locations have no numbers listed and the only way to contact them is through a form on their website. I have sent in two forms, I emailed their support a few times too but never heard anything back... I'm a little at a loss for words... and beans...

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has some recommendations please let me know....

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I was able to get into contact with Archetype, aparently everything had been shipped out but me and one other person had their coffee lost along the way.

Thank you all first and foremost for all the insight you've provided on multiple occasions. I always come here first to search my questions before deep-diving into the interwebs for answers.


Anyways, I was just listening to a podcast featuring Laird Hamilton where he mentioned his company's coffee that has added minerals and turmeric for health benefits.

I went to search turmeric on this sub but for the most part when it is mentioned people are asking about how to add it for taste reasoning. I'm not necessarily caring about taste because I get great tasting beans and always drinking my coffee black. I'm moreso focused on the health benefit side of it all, especially turmeric which I want to add into my diet (the idea of adding it daily via my coffee sounded perfect!). 

Just wanted to reach out and see if anyone has a daily coffee that has added turmeric and minerals and if so what are the ratios/dosage that you use, as well as what minerals? Also if anyone adds things aside from what I've mentioned too.

Looking to try to add some things to my daily coffee to keep me healthy :)

Something he mentioned in the podcast is the 'craving' feeling (aside from caffeine) that one gets, but having it in a healthy manner which he attributes to the minerals/turmeric.

A stronger, more deep chocolate-ish bitter cup that has a decent kick

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't enjoy:

Watery coffee that leaves nothing in my mouth or just plain bitterness (like Moka Pot coffee can do)

What i'm worried about when it comes to the Aeropress:

1. I saw that the coffee beans you have to use is fixed - 17 grams. I currently use 15 grams with the press and have an intention to go even a bit lower. I know that this sounds like a stupid and picky thing but it worries me a little bit.
2. From the videos I watched, everybody seems to describe Aeropress coffee as ""cleaner"" and less bitter. In my mind this can mean a more watery cup of coffee with more passive taste. Since I like bitterness it really is something I'm wondering about....

Lowkey interested in:

1. The fact that it keeps he oils away. Sometimes I have felt bloating after drinking coffee so this may or may not be the result of the oils. On the other hand oils= taste so
2. Is the aeropress forgiving when it comes to grind? I have a Hario Skertong which as we all know doesn't give you the best grind ever....

My manager at work got me addicted to espresso drinks. I would like to be able to make them at home in the morning without having to go to a coffee shop.

My experience making espresso drinks
1) Made some on my parent's Barista Express now and then. It seems to work okay, but wouldn't mind something that has a faster transition between espresso and steam.
2) Made a few on my friend's Sylvia (he calls it that like it is his girlfriend). He has this ritual of setting a timer when he first turns it on and making the espresso exactly when the timer goes off, so the water is just the right temperature. I don't think so this is my kind of espresso making.

My Espresso maker/grinder expectations:
1)  Makes hot milk with silky creamy foam.
2)  Makes at least Starbucks quality espresso (though preferably tasting a bit less like charcoal)
3) some way to pulverize beans into the correct quantity of powder with relatively little effort on my part.
4)heats water to the correct temperature without doing arcane rituals or set timers.
5) preferably let's me screw with the settings a little to tune things to my liking.
6) Makes it easy to reproduce the same results every morning.

Budget:
Grinder+Espresso machine for under $1000

Machines I have already been thinking about:
1) Breville Barista Pro,
2) Breville Barista Touch (It seems a little idiotic to put a touch display on the machine, but auto foaming sounds nice if it actually works)
3) Breville Bambino (but then I also need a grinder. Preferably a grinder that dispenses directly into the filter.)
4) Gaggia Brera (someone mentioned it on another post. Not really sure if it makes good silky foam. Don't really know much about it at all)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

I was wondering if maybe you could help me. I've purchased a set of steel burrs for my Vario-W since I only do pour-overs at home and having fewer fines in the ground sounded like a great idea.  

However, with the steel burrs in place, the grinder only produces basically dust, even on the coarsest setting. It also takes forever for the ground to get through. I've reached out to the baratza support and they helped me through the process of recalibrating it to 2Q - but it still only produces dust.  

I've changed back to the ceramics, which still work fine, back to steel, only dust..  

At this point baratza wants me to send it back for repair, but I'm wondering if there is something I can still do before doing that.  

To me it seems like the coffee is getting stuck between the burrs instead of being expelled out, any tips?

edit: after sending baratza a video of my struggles they think that the burrs are just not coming apart and are continuously touching, they have no idea why so they offered me a free repair - I'll stop screwing around with it myself at this point. thanks for all the helpful suggestions","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if maybe you could help me. I&amp;#39;ve purchased a set of steel burrs for my Vario-W since I only do pour-overs at home and having fewer fines in the ground sounded like a great idea.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with the steel burrs in place, the grinder only produces basically dust, even on the coarsest setting. It also takes forever for the ground to get through. I&amp;#39;ve reached out to the baratza support and they helped me through the process of recalibrating it to 2Q - but it still only produces dust.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve changed back to the ceramics, which still work fine, back to steel, only dust..  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point baratza wants me to send it back for repair, but I&amp;#39;m wondering if there is something I can still do before doing that.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me it seems like the coffee is getting stuck between the burrs instead of being expelled out, any tips?&lt;/p&gt;

I am in Australia and at the moment the Helor is $259 (conventional burr) and the C40 is $319-$329 AUD. The Lido 3 is $259 but decided not to go with it since it has a plastic body (unless someone can convince me I should get the Lido for other reasons). 

I am leaning towards buying the Helor since it is cheaper than the C40 and from what I've read it is as good, if not better. 

I have been using the rhinowares hand grinder for my aeropress but have shifted away from it and have been using the barista express grinder since the grind isn't as consistent. However the barista express grinder is really only tailored for espressos and so I am going to now just use it for my espressos (quite annoying having to dial in the grind size each time I switch the grinder for aeropress). 

My new grinder however will be primarily used for my chemex (which I have ordered), aeropress and the delta press. 

Any help would be great, didn't think it would be this hard to choose a grinder. But for me this is an investment for the long run and want to make the best decision I can make at the time. 

Things most important to me in a grinder is longevity, grind consistency and grinding time. Least important, is its ability to grind for espresso. While nice, I will using the grinder 99% of the time for pour over and immersion brewing.

Here's what I've done lately. For all of these, I use bottled water that's microwaved until boiling, then I use a thermometer to measure temps. I heat up 10oz water and fill the Aeropress to max capacity, then pour the rest into the mug when finished. 

Aeropress - I bring a few ziplocs to work with 18g worth of beans. Now, I'm using freshly roasted ones from S&amp;W roasting. I measure out my water to approx. 10oz, and heat to varying temperatures (189-205). Here's examples of what I've tried thus far, everything is inverted, and I'm using Aesir paper filters. I also have the standard filters that came with the AP, as well as a metal filter available. 

Attempt 1 - beans ground at 20 clicks from ""true zero"" (meaning, one click coarser allows the handle to rotate freely). Water temperature at 203, 15sec fill time, stir, (wet) filter and cap on. Wait 2:30, flip, press for 30 seconds. Pour the remaining 1oz or so of preheated water into mug. This resulted in a cup that honestly tasted ""burnt"". I've never experienced that before, so I assumed it means I've over extracted. After a few sips, I poured this out.

Attempt 2 - beans ground at 18 clicks. Water again at 203deg, faster pour this time, and in an attempt to compensate for the flavors from attempt 1, I only let it sit for 1:30. Flip, press, total time of 2 mins. Again, pour remaining 1oz water into mug. This cup tastes bland and watery. 

Attempts 3, 4, and 5 (yesterday) - settings of 21, 20, and 18, water temperature around 195 deg. Let sit for 1:30 to 2:00. Each of these tasted ""sour"" to me.

Kalita Wave - I have a 155 and 185. I've been using the 155 lately. Using a Bonavia gooseneck kettle.
Attempt 6 - setting of 23 clicks, pulse pour (after 30s bloom). The bed was super muddy, and the cup was unremarkable. I must've ground my beans too finely. Try again.

Attempt 7 - setting of 32 clicks, again, pulse pour (after 30sec bloom). The bed looked fine, but again, the cup was unremarkable. ""hollow"" is how I'd describe it.

Attempt 8 - grind setting of 28 clicks. This time I used the George Howell recipe in which I divided the total water weight by six and slowly poured until I hit that weight every fifteen seconds. I think the beans were ground too finely, because the water would be completely through my beans after about 10 seconds each time, so I'd just sit there waiting for 5 seconds until I hit my next ""pour"" interval. This cup was ""okay"", but didn't have any character really. Certainly no fruit notes or sweetness or anything.

Sorry for the length of this post, but I'm just looking for advice. For the Kalita. I think the best route would be to go to around 26 clicks and stick with George Howell. For the Aeropress, I'm basically lost, which is upsetting b/c I thought it was a very simple to use device. I have a single 18g baggie of Zambia Isanya, ground at 23 clicks, left at my desk for the remainder of the day. Any advice on how to brew this would be greatly appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trying for quite some time to figure out how to get an amazing cup of coffee, and I always end up with something that&amp;#39;s basically watery and bland.

I have a grinder Faema Magnum On Demand and I'm struggling a bit with the grind time settings. Apparently the grinder has 2 modes of settings - user mode and an engineering mode as they call it. In user mode the grind time is changeable just by clicking on + or - buttons depending on if it's a single or double dose and then adjusting the time. However to me it seems it just doesn't work at all in the user mode. Even if I set 1 second or 4 seconds for a single dose, it always grinds just 1 second, which is pre-set in the engineering mode.

To get into engineering mode, you need to turn off a grinder, wait a couple of seconds, then turn it on, press a combination of buttons and then adjust the time. This takes too long to be used in fast-paced production.

Also I should note that the user mode can be disabled from within the engineering settings, so it's not possible to change grind time when the grinder is turned on. Even though user mode is enabled, it just doesn't seem to be working for me...

Do you know if there's any trick on how to disable times set in the engineering mode and instead use grinding times set in the user mode? Thanks.

I'm travelling to the US this week and, as a daily Turkish coffee consumer, one of my first thoughts was ""how will I get my fix?""

I thought about buying a transformer and bringing my Simbo (I always take it with me on trips to Europe, where the voltage is 220V), but I never realized how big and bulky the step up transformers are.

I decided to look for a 110V brewer on Amazon and there were only about two options. This is the one I ordered:

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CGC9B4A/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o00\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CGC9B4A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

It seems to me that Turkish coffee is really not a ""thing"" in the US yet. I mean, it isn't really in Europe either, but there are at least better choices on [Amazon.co.uk](https://Amazon.co.uk).

A bigger question:  
Will Turkish coffee ever make it out of Turkish coffee and the Middle East and into the coffee mainstream.

The argument against is probably that it is inconvenient, but with my beloved Arzum automatic maker, it is actually more work to brew espresso.

I've started to wonder about other drinks that can take advantage of the water and grind adjustments.  Me, My first goal is trying to determine if I can make a 'cup O coffee'.  

So far I've learned that setting water to 1/2 way it pumps out 7oz and at all the way about 13oz.   Currently I'm testing ways to weight pucks at different settings by allowing pucks to dry out, then weigh. So far on my first test with the grind amount setting to max, I got 14 grams, about 2.5 tbsp loose packed.   At the factory setting at the 5th Dot, weighed 6 gram.   What these weights mean, IDK.   I will in the future see if I can up that by manually adding 1 Tbsp first then let the machine drop in a grind for a double!?

Update 05/23: Thanks to all the users who gave me suggestions, u/heyitsketchup u/mjacob u/Kep0a u/menschmaschine5 u/docmn612 u/American-_Gamer. The coffee machine and grinder are safe and sound in Boston. Here's what I ended up doing: I was traveling with family members, and had checked luggage with all of my items from home. I asked one of my family members to put the majority of their stuff in one of my checked bags and just wrapped the grinder (Breville Smart Grinder Pro) without the removable hopper. If you're doing the same, make sure you take a can of compressed air to the thing or you'll probably end up with grounds all over your belongings.

As for the espresso machine, I took a fairly large carry-on (I have a Ricardo(?) hard shell luggage with one of those expansion zippers, and stuffed it in with bed sheets and other stuff. Because the machine is about as wide as the luggage, I could only pick one side to cushion slightly with bed sheets and towels and whatnot, so I picked the side with the metal handle. When it came time to go through TSA, I just alerted one of the agents and removed both the grinder and machine from the carry on and put them on trays. Once they could see what they were, I got a few laughs and probably made it out of there the fastest I've ever made it through TSA. 

When placing it in the overhead compartment, I was extra careful and picked a compartment that became full with my bag, so that I could close it and it wouldn't be messed around with by someone trying to stuff more luggage and whatnot. I think this was definitely both the cheapest option as well as one that brought me the most peace of mind since I was handling the machine the entire time.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all!

Haven&amp;#39;t posted here before but I don&amp;#39;t really know where else to ask.

Hi coffee nerds,

Need some advice - would be especially useful to get input from people who've owned both. Trying to decide between two dual boiler espresso machines - the Breville Dual Boiler ($1299) and the Profitec Pro 300 ($1649). The grinder I own is a Sette 270. The espresso machine I used to own was a Capresso EC100 (super-cheap espresso machine from Costco).

My typical use case is making two to three drinks per day, at least one milk-based. I'd be the primary user but would also want my wife (who has never made espresso before) to be able to use it.

Overall, it seems like the BDB has more features but lower durability/longevity, and the Profitec has simpler features and supposedly higher durability. Features I'd be missing out on with the Profitec would be all the additional temp-regulation stuff, volumetric flow measurement, pre-infusion, auto-on at set time, and... an included tamper I guess? Durability-wise, the Profitec certainly looks like it's built better, but I don't have a clear idea on why Profitec is supposed to be more durable. What breaks on the BDB that doesn't break on the Profitec? Or is it that the BDB has more parts due to its higher complexity, and with more parts, there's more that could potentially break? A little bit of both? I can live with the latter (complexity decreasing durability) but the former (lower quality decreasing durability) is more damning.

I'm thinking this boils down to the following question: are the potentially higher quality and higher consistency from temp regulation and pre-infusion with the BDB worth the supposed durability issues?

Few random notes:

- Seems like the BDB has undergone several revisions over the years under the radar in an effort to improve durability. Lots of critical reviews out there but hard to understand if they're complaints of older models, or if durability is still an issue. Perhaps the newer BDBs don't have many of the durability issues of the past?

- BDB's volumetric flow meter system doesn't seem to be too consistent as per this post: https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/breville-dual-boiler-volumetric-problems-t48568-10.html.

- Profitec has an insulated wand and the BDB does not. Does this matter, if at all, as long as you're careful?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: went with the Profitec!

To calculate extraction% for my home brews (Clever/V60), I measure TDS, brew mass, find dissolved mass in the brew and divide by ground coffee dose mass (this should be normal/standard). For commercial equipment I am ordering a cup of drip coffee, measuring TDS etc., and making some assumptions about brew parameters based on my experience (working at specialty cafe).

&amp;#x200B;

No coffee has exceeded 1.30 on the TDS meter, the highest was a drip coffee (Guatemalan Gesha) which ran 1.27 and was very plainly over-extracted. Based on the math, no coffee I have brewed at home has exceeded 18% extraction. Unless batch brew in LA is brewed at much higher ratios than in Atlanta, most of the drip coffee I've been served has been sub 19% extraction, with the only exception being the overextracted Gesha.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this, the coffee at home and at shops has tasted pretty good to excellent. In particular, my home brews (on a Virtuoso and a Helor) have not broken 18% extraction, but have still shown signs of overextraction before coursening up again. The coffees have run the gamut of origins (though they have all been generally quite light in roast), and come from 6 different (specialty) shops. Now for the questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Are any of my assumptions unfounded (i.e. fairly standard batch recipes, extraction% formula, etc.)?
2. Are the results passing a sanity check? (extraction % at or below generally cited 18-22% standard range)
3. What should I change to get more accurate readings, if anything?

&amp;#x200B;

I think the main reason I am questioning these results is the overall low extraction% I have measured,and the low difference in extraction% between my home brew and commercial machines (.5-1.0%). Theoretically the 17.5% extractions I am hitting shouldn't be as sweet and complex as they are, and I would expect at least a few commercial cups to reach the 22% extractions that coffee bloggers (every week Rao hits a higher extraction...) like to brag about.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick edit, to talk about the TDS meter. I know the VST is standard, and the EC might not be as accurate because of non-ionic compounds in coffee. But, the particular meter I am using is on direct recommendation from Joseph Rivera, who co-founded Q-Grading and has years of experience analyzing coffee chemistry. The meter has at the very least been relatively accurate (in that attempting to increase extraction via, e.g., changing grind has led to a corresponding increase in measured TDS). So I can at least expect it to accurately measure the relative difference between my home coffee and commercial coffee, which I do feel ought to be higher.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For reference, I am using an EC TDS meter, the HM COM-100 one if you are familiar.

&amp;#x200B;

French Press was my first coffee brewing method and I’ve always wanted to perfect it because it was just too easy and cheap. 

I have always had decent results but also always thought that there is something missing. Right after every sip, I wasn’t really tasting the coffee as much as I wanted. The after taste was also weak and left me wondering if there is something I’m doing wrong. 

As with everything today – I googled it and saw Hoffman’s method which of course was something I tried. I tried it but for some reason the coffee was tasting even more thin and I was actually a bit frustrated by the results. For a period of time I was convinced that this technique actually produces a weaker and tasteless cup. 

So…for a while I stuck with:

1:14 ratio

Grind that is something around medium/medium coarse – between 6 and 8 clicks on Hario Skerton

30 seconds bloom

4 total minutes brew time

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago I bought some amazing Brazil beans and while they tasted great in my Moka Pot, they were really bland in the French Press. I know that Moka Pot coffee is more concentrated blah blah blah, but still, the difference was way too big for me and I just felt that something is off. 

Decided to revisit James Hoffmanns method with one big change – I changed the grind setting. 

First time I did:

1:15 ratio

Grind – a bit finer – 5 clicks on the Skerton

30 seconds bloom

10 minutes brew time with Hoffmans technique of removing the top grounds

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Wow…the result was much much better….and while I know that it is a combination of things – It was just a way more intense coffee and totally different experience, even with a more subtle ratio (1:15 instead of 1:14). This actually gave me hope and I did the same today, but went even finer – 4 clicks on the Skerton. Result was even better – just pure amazing coffee. I had some sediment in the cup because even with 10 minutes of brewing, but the cup was still amazing. I can’t imagine going 

&amp;#x200B;

That all said, I guess my conclusion is that after all the videos and after all the articles I’ve read, combining widely accepted brewing technique and my personal taste ended up giving me the best cup. I could have gone for years drinking the same bland and tasteless cup thinking that this is what the French press is capable of.

Thought I would give this a shot before calling Baratza. Will try to keep this as brief as possible.

 

So after two or three years of trouble-free use, one day the grinder just…stopped working, no motor or anything. I checked inside the chute and underneath the hopper for clogs. Nada. Removing the hopper and burr holder and cleaning the crap out of it didn’t help, like it usually does. I checked to make sure there was no give underneath/around the adjustment ring disc. I made sure the plastic burr holder was in place (red notch at 5 o’clock position). I made sure the plastic burr holder had its three outside notches intact and that the four plastic pieces surround the burr were good. Also confirmed all electric cables appeared seated OK.

 

I finally got it to work again after manually rotating the burr about 90 degrees clockwise. Once I did that and rotated the adjustment ring a few notches, the motor turned back on when I pressed the grind button. Cool. So I rotated the ring counter-clockwise as far as it would go, then put the grinder back together. The hopper didn’t want to go back on, as if something was slightly in the way. Managed to get it back on, encountered some resistance, and things seemed to…pop back into place, as the ring approached setting 1? Hard to describe, but after that I was able to rotate it freely as usual. And the grinder still turned on when I pressed the button.

 

Something was still wrong, though. It was able to grind coffee, yes, but the grind was all off. I normally use setting 14 for drip coffee. This resulted in way too fine a grind, almost like espresso. I had to dial it up to 24 to get the former equivalent of 14. Annoying but workable, except this whole process kept repeating itself. I would periodically have to manually rotate the burr to get the motor going again.

 

I read about the three calibration notches and wondered if, after a few years of use, it was just time to recalibrate? But my calibration screw is already in the left-most window, which I believe is the coarse grind setting? If I’m already having to increase my setting to hit semi-coarse grind, wouldn’t recalibrating for neutral or fine just make it worse, not better?

 

Has anyone run into anything that sounds similar to this? My wife and I both work from home, so our jobs don’t give me much latitude to call Baratza and spend a lot of time troubleshooting.

I generally like *iced* coffee with a little espresso, lots of milk and caramel sauce (I like cream too).

\-iced caffe latte

\-iced caramel latte

\-caramel cream frappuccino

I was just curious as to the differences in your methods of dialing in when working with espresso vs pour over (or any other brew method really). I have worked in coffee for a few years and never really thought much about the differences in the way I approach these two different brew methods.

 I was up late watching some videos on YouTube about coffee, as one does, and noticed that the way Matt Perger discusses dialing in espresso is ~~the opposite of~~ different than the way James Hoffmann discusses dialing in a recipe for brewed coffee. Where Matt Perger suggests locking in a dose, then a yield, and adjusting time by adjusting grind, James Hoffman suggests starting by adjusting your grind, then when you’re happy with taste, adjust your ratio for your desired strength. 

For me, with espresso I’m generally not adjusting my grind unless it obviously needs to be adjusted, using a timer to check for unusually long or short pre-infusion and extraction times. I will however mess with the ratios if I’m unhappy with the taste, then adjust the grind to sort of finesse the espresso into a better place. With brewed coffee (for me a V60) , however I usually have a ratio that I start with immediately, and do not change. Instead I will change grind or adjust my pours to extend or shorten brew times. I know espresso and brewed coffee are two different beasts. Just curious to hear your methods and thoughts.

I thought maybe it was a problem with the washer size, so I even got technical specs for the total height of the washers underneath the paddle wheel (under the burr) and under the main gear, and still no dice.

Any thoughts? It's getting ridiculous.

Final Edit for posterity:

u/Tag1260 is a hero. Pointed out that the burr should be rotating clockwise, not counterclockwise. Turns out I plugged in the cable connecting the motor to the circuit board with the opposite polarity (to any future readers--make sure the red cable is on the outside as in [this picture](https://baratza.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ElectricalCheck.pdf)).

Comment on washer/shim arrangement: the encore comes with 5 washers-- one 1.5 mm, 1 0.25 mm, and 3 0.5 mm. Two good arrangements are

I thought maybe it was a problem with the washer size, so I even got technical specs for the total height of the washers underneath the paddle wheel (under the burr) and under the main gear, and still no dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts? It&amp;#39;s getting ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final Edit for posterity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/Tag1260""&gt;u/Tag1260&lt;/a&gt; is a hero. Pointed out that the burr should be rotating clockwise, not counterclockwise. Turns out I plugged in the cable connecting the motor to the circuit board with the opposite polarity (to any future readers--make sure the red cable is on the outside as in &lt;a href=""https://baratza.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ElectricalCheck.pdf""&gt;this picture&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comment on washer/shim arrangement: the encore comes with 5 washers-- one 1.5 mm, 1 0.25 mm, and 3 0.5 mm. Two good arrangements are  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- 2.75 mm under the paddlewheel (the little plastic part that fits snugly into the bottom burr) + 0.5 mm below the main gear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- 2.25 mm under the paddlewheel + 1.5 mm below the gear&lt;/p&gt;

However, yesterday I hit a point where no matter how I brew this coffee I'm coming out with bland cups that have almost no acidity or subtle tasting notes at all.

I use filtered water right off boil using a Baratza Encore to grind and brew into V60 or Kalita 102.  My normal pour-over setting for the Encore is 14 but I do normally adjust between 12-17.  1:15 ratio and aim for 2:30-3 minute extractions.  

My first thought after brewing a cup this morning was ""Man, I can be so inconsistent with the V60.""  I switched to my Kalita and ended up with the same results.  I then tried brewing multiple cups with different grinds, going as low as 10 and as high as 15.  The cup brewed with the grinds on the 10 setting of the Encore was mildly astringent but still pretty bland.  The cup brewed with 15 as the setting was just watery and awful.  

What could cause this?  Or what could I be doing wrong?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the strange sounding title but I&amp;#39;m wondering if it&amp;#39;s normal for lightly roasted beans to become less flavorful or harder to extract using a pour over?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a bag of light roast beans from a great roaster that was roasted on 5/7.  My first few cups all came out exactly as described by the tasting notes on the bag.  However, yesterday I hit a point where no matter how I brew this coffee I&amp;#39;m coming out with bland cups that have almost no acidity or subtle tasting notes at all.&lt;/p&gt;

Excuse the spelling and grammar, as English is not my first language.

I wanted to make a guide to specialty coffee in Copenhagen because i find myself commenting on posts when people are traveling to Denmark and are in search of good coffee. This guide will consists of my personal opinions and yours are allowed to differ.

I will start out with places I have been and can recommend, then I will make a list of places I intend to visit and lastly I will branch out to other places in Denmark (and maybe other Nordic countries) where I have found great coffee. I would love a lively (and civil) discussion of the coffee scene in Denmark in the comments and if there are places you would like to recommend please don't hesitate to do so in the comments as I am always looking for new places to visit. I will also try to update this guide as time goes by.

**Places I have been to and can recommend:**

**Impact roasters:** 

in Valby, the roaster is from Ethiopia and the only do Ethiopian coffee but have different beans so they can serve everyone’s taste. They do v60 and chemex. They have tow shops one at Valby train Station and Langgade train Station. The one at Langgade station is their first shop and also my favorite, great space (the old train ticket office) here they also do workshops on coffee, roasting and the Ethiopian Coffee ceremony.

**Coffee Collective:** 

All over Copenhagen, we have Coffee Collective which was one of the roasters who started the Nordic light roast trend, I would visit coffeecollective at jægersborggade in Nørrebro because it is such a cozy streets with nice places to eat drink and shop. They do Kalita wave and aeropress. They are necessary when in Copenhagen and if you like light roasts.

**The Corner @ Restaurant 108 :** 

Speaking of Nordic roasters the restaurant **“108”** has a corner of their restaurant which functions as a coffee and wine bar where they serve coffee by the famous Norwegian roaster **Tim Wendelboe** so here you can sample some high quality beans roasted well. **“108”** also serves amazing food so the restaurant I highly recommend as well but pop in for a coffee outside **“108”** there is a square with a lot of good streetfood “broens gadekøkken” which is a nice hangout spot in the summertime.

**Risteriet Coffee Studie:**

Then in the center of Copenhagen not far from the central station we have Risteriet, they have a wonderfull selection of coffee they roast themselves. They do v60, aeropress and, if you ask me, the best cortado in town. They sell espresso machines and coffee gear as well. I always swing by when I am in the city center. They are also in Frederiksberg.

**Prolog coffee bar:** 

In the hip meatpacking district, we have Prolog coffee bar, it’s a small space but they have a high quality beans which they roast themselves, they do v60. The meatpacking district is good for food, drinks, and a cool vibe.

**Andersen &amp; Maillard:** 

in Nørrebro who roast themselves the are also a bakery which make really nice stuff, especially the croissants which they bake three times a day in order to serve fresh! They do aeropress og kalita but I would go for the pastries alone.

**CUB Coffee Bar:** 

Boldhusgade, here I felt like I had found a gem you could miss it easy, it's in a basement. Nice coffee and awesome atmosphere. They do kalita and aeropress.

**Coffee First:** 

By Vesterport station just across from the Tycho Brahe Planetarium. They get their beans from a local copenhagen roastery called Estate, they do v60. They also sell coffee equipment. They also make cocktails. I love to come by here get a filter coffee to go and take a walk along the lakes of Copenhagen which is just across from the café.

**Kaffeplantagen:** 

A nice café in Vesterbro they have a multitude of origins, which they roast themselves, they do v60 and espresso based drinks. The food is nice too.

**Sonny:** 

By the biggest shopping street “Strøget” and “Nytorv” in the middle of Copenhagen, Sonny has lovely food (try the sonny avocado combo on ryebread) and a great selection of beans. They feature different roasters, right now they have one of my favorite roasters from Århus, Jutland **“la cabra”** if you can’t make it to Århus during your stay in Denmark at least you can taste some of their amazing coffee here.

**Original Coffee:** 

They roast themselves and have a wide range of origins. They do pourover. Original Coffee have a couple of cafés across Copenhagen I’m going to highlight two of them. **Original Coffee Illum** this one is right in the city center, on top of one of Copenhagen’s biggest malls Illum, great place to shop. The café is on the top floor and there is a balcony, which runs along the building, the coffee is nice but I would go for the view of Copenhagen alone. **Original Coffee Bredgade**, this café is just by the castle “Amalienborg” (where the Danish queen lives). The café is small but also the place that introduced me to espresso tonics (love them in the summer). If you visit during the summer months and want to see the castle don’t forget to swing by and grab a espresso tonic for your walk around, also do see the garden as well “Amaliehaven”.

**Roast Coffee:**

Their quality is just amazing, they roast themselves at the café and you can see the roaster. Whenever possible they buy their beans via “the cup excellence”. They also have their own label, which they have dubbed “50-50”. The “50-50” label is Roast’s signature branded coffee that guarantees the farmers 50% of the retail price, which I just love. This is where I have most consistently bought beans for home brewing. Great variety and excellently roasted they ship internationally so please check them out.

**Copenhagen Coffee Lab:** 

They are situated outside the city center at Amager great coffee, which they source and roast themselves; they do pour over as well as espresso drinks. If you are here, do yourself a favor and visit “Wulff &amp; Konstali Food Shop” best food for miles specifically their brunch.

**Reffen Coffee Roasters:** 

Reffen is, to quote from their webpage “An urban playground for co-creation, innovation, food and creativity - and last but not least - the largest street food market in the Nordics.” At Reffen we have Reffen coffee roaster which is actually run by **Nordhavn Coffee Roasters**, they have created a space where they sell their roasted coffee, do workshops and cuppings. I have had fun bringing my non-coffee geeks here to let them taste different origins. I urge tourists to visit Reffen and if you are into beer do seek out Mikkeller Baghaven while you are there (great space, view and beer).

&amp;#x200B;

**Places I want to visit in Copenhagen:**

**Navnløs Kaffebar**

**Democratic Coffee**

**Sweet Treat**

**Café Det Vide Hus**

**Darcy's Kaffe**

**Statement**

&amp;#x200B;

**Coffee places in Århus, Jutland, Demark:**

**Stiller’s Coffee:** 

previously known as Great Coffee but still the same attention to detail and great coffee, lovely space.

**La Cabra:** 

They source and roast themselves and do a damn good job, really lovely café in the charming old Latin quarter of Århus they do v60 and chemex (if I remember correctly). They also have a coffee subscription and ship worldwide so do check them out.

&amp;#x200B;

**Various:**

**Jan’s Kaffebar, Denmark, Zealand, Køge:** 

The town where I grew up has gotten a proper specialty coffee bar and I love Jan for it. I always visit him when I’m back home. He has collaborated with local roaster from **Køge Kafferisterri** so he always has fresh roasts on hand. Recently he is offering some of **Coffee Collective’s** coffee also. V60 and espresso based drinks. The place is small but the coffee is good and a to go cup is perfect for wandering around this beautiful medieval town. Tell him Rasmus sent you.

**Koppi coffee roasters, Helsingborg, Sweden:** 

Just amazingly roasted and sourced coffee, you can reach Helsingborg by car in an hour, but there is also a great connection from the Danish town of Helsingør to Helsingborg by ferry (the scenic route). Their roastery is in helsingborg but you have to book an appointment they don’t have official visiting hours. I have not been but I have had some of the best beans form this roastery, tasted their coffee and chatted with them at conventions. The art on the coffee bags is beautiful. They offer subscriptions and international shipping as well. Highly recommended.

Hope you have a nice time and some of the recommendations are to your liking.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guide to specialty coffee in Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;La Cabra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They source and roast themselves and do a damn good job, really lovely café in the charming old Latin quarter of Århus they do v60 and chemex (if I remember correctly). They also have a coffee subscription and ship worldwide so do check them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Various:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jan’s Kaffebar, Denmark, Zealand, Køge:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town where I grew up has gotten a proper specialty coffee bar and I love Jan for it. I always visit him when I’m back home. He has collaborated with local roaster from &lt;strong&gt;Køge Kafferisterri&lt;/strong&gt; so he always has fresh roasts on hand. Recently he is offering some of &lt;strong&gt;Coffee Collective’s&lt;/strong&gt; coffee also. V60 and espresso based drinks. The place is small but the coffee is good and a to go cup is perfect for wandering around this beautiful medieval town. Tell him Rasmus sent you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koppi coffee roasters, Helsingborg, Sweden:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just amazingly roasted and sourced coffee, you can reach Helsingborg by car in an hour, but there is also a great connection from the Danish town of Helsingør to Helsingborg by ferry (the scenic route). Their roastery is in helsingborg but you have to book an appointment they don’t have official visiting hours. I have not been but I have had some of the best beans form this roastery, tasted their coffee and chatted with them at conventions. The art on the coffee bags is beautiful. They offer subscriptions and international shipping as well. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you have a nice time and some of the recommendations are to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

For those interested in background and specifics:

I've just reached the stage where waiting for CoffeeHit to restock MK3 at their lower price suddenly made sure I had no problem paying £50 more to get it asap elsewhere... In other words impatient about good coffee. Which is why I after a good week of trial want to get the fine deets down. 

I did say fine, because I was very surprised at how many fines grinds for a V60 have produced. Every cup I have brewed has had a muddy bed. Which is ironic to me considering I just replaced my mothers entry Melitta electrical grinder (6 months old) for the cheapest Wilfa Svart because I couldn't drink her over-extracted brews. This Wilfa has barely produced any fines during it's first month of use, naturally I expect this to get worse but as for now, it produces a better cup of coffee than my MK3. Hence, I want to make sure that my expectations that the Comandante will be consistent in the long term and at least not get worse, are valid?

&amp;#x200B;

I brew mostly Scandinavian-light roasts V60, but my boyfriend prefers dark pour overs. We share the odd french press and cold brew in Summer, I have yet to try grinding for these on the Comandante. I'm almost scared as to what I will find out re fines. I have realised it needs a daily clean, so far I have only been gently blowing and shaking. My old brush does not fit inside, does anyone have links to a good one? Any other maintenance tips?

&amp;#x200B;

For years I've been using the Hario Skerton and I'm looking for something that's less of a hassle and that is easier to control between types of grind. I mostly brew cold brew through a Toddy or pour over through a Beehouse, with the occasional French Press usage. Espresso usage is not something I need.

The Baratza Encore/Virtuoso is good enough for the pour-over/French Press but I have concerns about their ability to grind 12 oz of coffee in one go (once a week, for cold brew concentrate). Herein lies my dilemma: the gap between entry level Bartazas and retail-friendly grinders like a Mahlkonig is pretty massive.

So I'm seeking your help! I'm looking for something that will consistently grind for pour over, french press and cold brew concentrates (all relatively coarse grinds) and that can handle the occasional full-bag grind without risk of burning out (or which can be repaired easily should motor burnout be a thing).

* I like coffee, I'll buy a Keurig.

* The kuerig is nice, but for lots of people, lets get a french press and a grinder (blade) you know, for company.
* Wow this Pike Place is great in the French Press, I want one for work.
* I am sick of grinding beans at home, I'll get a cheap hand grinder on Amazon (Polrex Mini Knockoff) for the office.

Then I found this sub, I upgraded my life and got an aeropress to take to and from work, and found a **few local roasters** (after trying bean box). Things were going okay, but the 3-5 min it took me to grind 17-20g of coffee through that junk grinder sucked. Eventually the plastic in the grinder started to shred and the burrs were cracking. So I tossed it and resided to grinding beans at home in the blade grinder and bring them to the office each day for the aeropress. Not ideal but I wasn't wasting money on a cheap grinder again. Plus, to be honest, the grind quality wasnt *that* different between the blade and the cheap burr. the burr had less fines, but just as many boulders, and since the aeropress is forgiving, it was always a passable cup.

I had my heart set on the helor 101, but randomly changed course, pulled the trigger, and got an ~~m57~~ m47 Traveler from prima coffee. 

Well, first im dumb. I thought the grind adjustment was only a single turn. Turned the dial from being burr locked to 3, threw some starbucks beans we had lying around from a christmas gift in (im not wasting good beans on a trial grind) and nothing came out... wtf.... so i turn it to 5. nothing. so i turn it to 9, and holy smokes i could have pressed what came out into a makeup tin.... it was literal powder... woah. So realizing I had to turn the dial over a few times I got the coarseness I usually aimed for in the past. I shook the junk beans out, loaded in 18 grams of the good stuff, and was SHOCKED when the hoper quit grinding.... ""Its already done? what? that was faster than the electric blade grinder! (I pulse). What!?!?"" So I threw it in the inverted aeropress, added water just off boil, fill the press half way, one minute bloom/brew, stir, fill to the top and wait another minute, cap it and and press it. 

Unbelievable. I literally cannot believe it. If this wasn't the same bag of beans, I would have assumed I got a crazy good batch. I cannot believe the amount of flavor this just created. What even is this.... 

HANDS DOWN the best cup of joe I have ever had. IN-SANE. The ease of grinding, the speed of grinding, the smoothness. The coffee, all of it. Assuming this grinder lasts me 5 years at least, it will be the best $230 I have ever spent. Just wow.

Edit.... thinking about getting a 3 cup Chemex for the office now. This rabbit hole is worse than r/mk

Edit 2: I get my beans from desert oasis in Detroit and the red dot in Northville MI (Mad Cap Beans from Grand Rapids). I don’t need better beans.

Edit 3: The grinder adjustment has this super satisfying click.... like the crank on a bicycle almost, or a way softer turning of a ratchet.

&lt;p&gt;HANDS DOWN the best cup of joe I have ever had. IN-SANE. The ease of grinding, the speed of grinding, the smoothness. The coffee, all of it. Assuming this grinder lasts me 5 years at least, it will be the best $230 I have ever spent. Just wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit.... thinking about getting a 3 cup Chemex for the office now. This rabbit hole is worse than &lt;a href=""/r/mk""&gt;r/mk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: I get my beans from desert oasis in Detroit and the red dot in Northville MI (Mad Cap Beans from Grand Rapids). I don’t need better beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 3: The grinder adjustment has this super satisfying click.... like the crank on a bicycle almost, or a way softer turning of a ratchet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 4: &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/gKTpMilDH0Q""&gt;takes about 20 seconds to grind 17g&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/kmP5qN4/""&gt;to this courseness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Recently I have fallen into the water rabbit hole and interested to learn more. The Barista Hustle guide is also very informative - thank-you! https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/8cqlqs/barista_hustle_diy_water_20_spreadsheet/

I would like to better understand the importance of the DI water for making brew water. In my case, I mainly brew espresso. Where I live (Vancouver, BC), we have notoriously pure tap water:

From one of our reservoirs, we can approximate:

--
Aluminum - 0.1mg/L

Calcium - 1mg/L

Magnesium - 0.1mg/L

Potassium - 0.1mg/L

Sodium - 5mg/L

Alaklinity - 8.4mg/L

Silica - 2.5mg/L

TDS - 21mg/L

--

What are your thoughts on using this water profile vs. DI water? I suspect if I were to follow the barista hustle recipes, that I would fall still well within the desired Ca, Mg, and TDS values... but seeking your input here.

My main motivation here is to save on cost and trouble, i.e. buying/lugging around gallons of DI water week to week.

That, combined with BBB for some reason accepting the 20% coupon, and I jumped (fully aware of the temperature issue some have reported).  Since then, I've been through a bag of Intelligentsia beans and nearly a bag of Metropolis beans and have \*maybe\* gotten one decent pull.  It's been gross shot after gross shot.

I know you are supposed to keep everything constant except the grind size, but it grinds by time, not weight, so presumably, changing the grind size also changes the weight.  (Tried to counteract by weighing).  Except where I got the grind size way too small, the extraction consistently starts between 7 and 8 seconds after hitting the brew button, which is apparently bordering on underextraction.  I have tried to determine, but haven't to my satisfaction, whether maybe it is suffering from temperature issues.  I have recorded it as high as 175, but changing the settings to make it hotter made not much difference.  The ""cup warmer"" seemingly does nothing.  The hot water is certainly hot enough to steam up a shot glass.

&amp;#x200B;

So ... is this user error to a total extreme?  Is something wrong with the machine?  I guess either way, if I can't get decent espresso out of it, I can't keep it.

There's a celebrated (at least as far as I can see on this subreddit) coffee roaster in Toronto called De Mello Palheta, but I don't really get what they're doing with their sour light roasts. They will often have different coffee from different places, but the only thing I can taste is the acidity.

Here are two examples on their website that I felt were the same (and there are several others I had before, which are no longer on their website):

1. [Ecuador Pillcocaja](http://hellodemello.net/shop/ecuador-pillcocaja): Pineapple, Pomegranate, Juicy

2. [Colombia El Globito](http://hellodemello.net/shop/colombia-el-globito): Apricot, Passion Fruit, Bubble Gum

Here are things I get:

1. Tasting notes are not very objective. I'm not looking to see exactly the descriptions they use.

2. Acidity is a flavor enhancer, but there needs to something to enhance in the first place for the acidity to be used effectively.

What am I missing? At this point, I feel like I'm just drinking coffee from under-ripe coffee cherries. Did it take you guys a while to ""get"" sour coffee?

For context, light roasts are my favorite style of roast (which I usually have with pour-over type methods). [This roaster](https://www.thelibraryspecialtycoffee.com/collections/frontpage) has been kind of amazing in that every coffee has distinct and focused characteristics that are all quite different. They even had a sour one which I eventually started to really like after I was about halfway through the bag.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;m really hoping this thread does not get derailed into a discussion about under-extraction or roasting defects.

&amp;nbsp;

To begin, here is a list of my equipment:

* I am using the 51mm pressurized portafilter that came with the machine which limits me from using the recommended 17-18g coffee ground input. 
* Sumatra Coffee beans (Indonesian) from Costco - medium roast
* Breville Smart Grinder Pro - Default burr setting with grind setting ranging from 8 - 25 (struggling here), grind time hasn't been set yet as I measure alongside grinding
* Breville Cafe Roma
* Kitchen Scale
* Espresso cup capacity is 2 oz

&amp;nbsp;

My trials @14g of coffee:

* Grind setting 8 - this leads to the machine struggling to pull a shot and takes a long time for it to get halfway in the cup
* Grind setting 10 - The shot pulls rather quickly (~10s), it doesn't taste good and I believe it is acidic although I am not sure, and the output results in about 50g
* Grind setting 20 - Still tastes off and output is ~44g

&amp;nbsp;

There were many other trials but these are the most recent that I recall. I am looking for advice on where I can improve (should I try coarser, lessen the weight of the coffee input, am i being too analytical, ...).

I've been a major coffee fan for about 7-8 months now and this is my first post on this sub.

I have a Royal Worcester Bone China coffee set, and when I did some research I read that the coffee served from such a pot was usually much stronger than the coffee served today. Is that correct? and how would I go about making such a coffee?

&amp;#x200B;

I am just wondering if this is a normal thing to happen. I have a Rhinowares Small Hand Grinder ([LINK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rhinowares-Small-Grinder-Adapter-Aeropress/dp/B01AAE8SP4/)) and I have found that the notches on the locking nut (if that is the right term) which I use to adjust grind size has worn away. I've only been using the grinder for a couple of months, so i'm surprised this has happened so quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

It's almost as if the plastic on the locking nut is softer than the plastic of the notches on the ceramic burr. It's really weird. It's just gone completely smooth and so it loosens during use, meaning the grind size varies.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else experienced this, either with this brand or any other?

1st - I had exactly 10g left of the coffee I've been brewing the past 2 weeks. All of the brews have been OK, had some decent cups out of it but the tasting notes never really stood out to me. But the cupping flavor just blew my mind! I could not believe how strong of a tea flavor came out, which is one of the listed tasting notes! 

This bums me out because it means my brewing technique isn't pulling these notes out. I typically use a Kalita for a week and a V60 for a week to see what differences I can pull out. Neither of these came close to the cupping flavor!

2nd - With my new bag of coffee I made 2 cuppings, one with my tap water (which is decent water I drink daily) and one with reverse-osmosis water with minerals re-added I get from my local grocery. In a blind taste test the RO water (not coffee) tastes better for sure. Sure enough the tap water brew was very muddled, no real distinct flavors coming out and kind of boring. The RO water cupping is **way** more interesting and nuanced. 

As a result I think I'll being more diligent about taking my water jug to the store to get it filled every week!

In regards to my #1 point, I have found a local coffee shop that uses a Clever produces consistently awesome cups of coffee. I've always enjoyed the brewing process and tweaking variables but I'm thinking about going down the immersion brewing path. It just seems less...fun?

Anyone have any thoughts on immersion brewing or just any of this in general? Would shooting for longer extractions with a V60 or Kalita like 3:30 potentially bring out a similar result to an immersion brew?

I recently picked up the entry level Baratza Encore because of the knowledge from this group. Being that I love to squeeze as much as I can out of the coin I spend, I thought it would be awesome to modify the Encore to be like the Preciso that costs over twice as much. Because these grinders share so many parts, I figured it was worth the $12 (shipping included) to see if it was possible. I read some posts that some people had attempted it, but I never saw pictures or confirmation of that. Turns out, you can definitely use the Preciso adjustment ring on the Encore with a case modification!

&amp;#x200B;

I contemplated replacing the burr as well, but after forking out $135 for the grinder, I was already over budget and I wanted to see how the M3 would perform. During this process I found some other things I wanted to change.

One is the lower burr o-ring. The stock o-ring had a sloppy fitment, so I replaced it with a [Danco #62](https://www.menards.com/main/plumbing/rough-plumbing/plumbing-installation-repair/faucet-repair/o-rings-faucet-washers/danco-trade-62-o-ring/9d0035776b/p-1444428665759-c-8544.htm?searchTermToProduct=6744687) from the hardware store. This size needed quite a bit of stretching to get it over the burr, but it resulted in a very good fit in the housing (a larger diameter o-ring closer to the size of the burr fit too tight). Another side effect of replacing this o-ring with a tighter one is that it makes the hopper harder to turn, keeping the grind setting in place during grinding if you remove the detent to make it stepless. Baratza may have made the lower burr a sloppy fit so the burrs mesh together better for grinding espresso, but I'm not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lower burr o-ring replacement](https://i.redd.it/trn5zpo0w6y21.jpg)

The other was the power switch location. The on/off switch is in an undesirable place for my use and I didn't see using the pulse button at all. I used the wires from that button for my toggle switch. The new location allows my thumb leverage to turn on the switch. I like a lot better!

&amp;#x200B;

As far as performance of the grinder, I haven't put many beans through it yet. I'll see how it does for repeat-ability after using it for different grinds in the coming weeks. I don't have an espresso machine, so I won't be able to tell if the grind is decent for pulling shots. The bottom line is, for $12, you can add fine adjustment capability to the entry level Encore.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is the lower burr o-ring. The stock o-ring had a sloppy fitment, so I replaced it with a &lt;a href=""https://www.menards.com/main/plumbing/rough-plumbing/plumbing-installation-repair/faucet-repair/o-rings-faucet-washers/danco-trade-62-o-ring/9d0035776b/p-1444428665759-c-8544.htm?searchTermToProduct=6744687""&gt;Danco #62&lt;/a&gt; from the hardware store. This size needed quite a bit of stretching to get it over the burr, but it resulted in a very good fit in the housing (a larger diameter o-ring closer to the size of the burr fit too tight). Another side effect of replacing this o-ring with a tighter one is that it makes the hopper harder to turn, keeping the grind setting in place during grinding if you remove the detent to make it stepless. Baratza may have made the lower burr a sloppy fit so the burrs mesh together better for grinding espresso, but I&amp;#39;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.redd.it/trn5zpo0w6y21.jpg""&gt;Lower burr o-ring replacement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other was the power switch location. The on/off switch is in an undesirable place for my use and I didn&amp;#39;t see using the pulse button at all. I used the wires from that button for my toggle switch. The new location allows my thumb leverage to turn on the switch. I like a lot better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.redd.it/4mul58zx07y21.jpg""&gt;Encore toggle switch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as performance of the grinder, I haven&amp;#39;t put many beans through it yet. I&amp;#39;ll see how it does for repeat-ability after using it for different grinds in the coming weeks. I don&amp;#39;t have an espresso machine, so I won&amp;#39;t be able to tell if the grind is decent for pulling shots. The bottom line is, for $12, you can add fine adjustment capability to the entry level Encore.&lt;/p&gt;

I took a reddit break for the past couple years but it's fun to be back in the community. Here are some things I have learned in my past 6 year drinking specialty coffee (not espresso).

&amp;#x200B;

one) Don't overthink it. Really. We all spend so much wasted energy the few couple years trying to figure out dialing in and what under and over extraction tastes like (and that is very important!), but really it's about enjoying the beverage we love, the ritual of making it, and exploring each new bean / prepared cup. If it is an over extracted cup, but has lots of flavor still, enjoy what's there! It might have some (positive) flavors that you don't get when it is properly extracted. Which brings me to #2

&amp;#x200B;

two) Get to know your grinder. The easiest way to learn the flavors is to go way too far in both directions. I personally love my Encore, even knowing there are better manuals for the money. I just love the ease and do think it is good enough to get coffee shop level quality extraction (not for espresso). I thought I had a dialed range when I started and all of my Wave cups were extremely hit or miss. It wasn't until years later when I knew the tastes of over and under waaay better, that I took my old Wave back out and realized that I was like 8 clicks too coarse on my encore (seriously). If I have made coffee with every 2-3 clicks on the entire machine, I think I would have realized it would extract better finer, sooner.

&amp;#x200B;

three) Immersion really doesn't over extract. IMO, the main reason /u/jimseven 's method is so popular is because it fully extracts the coffee. I used to do his original [blog post](https://jimseven.com/2010/11/04/cupping-vs-french-press/) recipe which was 14 minutes and it still never became bitter, which he wrote basing it on cupping. When I make FP, I grind a few clicks coarser than my 24g v60 size, add water at 1:14 ratio, stir after some time and then pour after some time. I literally don't ever time it but I probably usually pour around 10 minutes. It never over extracts. I started to do a similar recipe with my aeropress. Same grind as FP, pour 1:14 ratio, wait a few minutes, stir, wait a few minutes more, press, maybe sometime between 6-9 minutes. It has been getting me cups that are different but on the same level as v60 which is a welcome surprise and all I've been drinking the past week. I think I would actually do the same type recipe on a Clever if I had one again.

&amp;#x200B;

four) Water matters - The mineral content and ph of water determines what is ""pulled"" out during extraction. If a coffee from a shop tastes wildly different at home, its most certainly water. Same with a coffee from afar with tasting notes that are way different from the well extracted cups you are making. When I lived in Boston, I started to make my own water based on an updated recipe by /u/canekicker who was nice enough to converse with me and it made a huge difference. Maybe he can chime in and share it if he'd like. When I moved to Colorado, the tap water made just as good coffee as the homemade water so I stopped making it. People seem to like 3WW but from what I've learned, I'd want some buffer (Sodium Bicarb).

&amp;#x200B;

five) Don't get stuck in coffee stereotypes. You can find washed centrals that are as wild as Ethiopian Naturals. Some Ethiopians taste like chocolatey Americans. There are Colombians that you would think are Kenyans in a blind test. Seriously. Don't get stuck on a region. Try them all and keep trying them all. I personally like Indos less than every other region, but one of my best home roasts was a Sumatran Aceh from Sweet Maria's. It was maybe the naturally sweetest coffee I ever roasted (in a popper no less).

&amp;#x200B;

six) Naturals extraction - My wife stumbled upon this one. For years, we would get hit or miss extraction with naturals and we always felt like we weren't getting their full potential. My wife tried making a cup much stronger with one and it was bursting with the flavors listed. So we started doing that for all naturals and it kept working. With my v-60, I usually do around 1:15 or slightly stronger. With naturals, I always do around 1:13 or slightly stronger and it's been a game changer, truly.

&amp;#x200B;

seven) Water temp - I think it matters far less than some make it out to (and I've made it out to in the past as well). I think off the boil is fine as it loses temp and become inside the 195-205 slurry temp that is recommended. I'm at altitude so off the boil for me is 206, but at sea level, I also used off the boil and at 212 it was great, too. I think anywhere between 206-212 is best. Now if you are playing with aeropress recipes, that is a different story... **EDIT:** /u/mikethebluecow pointed out that water temp extraction can depend on certain factors. So for me saying off boil is fine, A) I'm now using water that is 206 off boil and not 212 anymore and B) my particular water has it's own specific hardness and chemical makeup. Also, I'm always using light roasts. If you find that your coffee does much better at a different temp, than do what you know works! Your water might be much harder or softer or you might be using darker roasts. Everything is individual. In the 2 places I lived, everything between 206-212 worked fine, but that is a limited set of data.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT**: eight) Get a good enough grinder. If you haven't bought a grinder yet, save up and get one that is good enough. Baratza Encore or one of the many manuals that are popular. If you have a mini mill or equivalent, start saving up and get a better one. It's near impossible to get a good extraction on the low end grinders and you'll pull your hair out trying to figure out how to do the impossible (get even extraction).

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT 2**: nine) Freezing coffee. There was a lot of back and forth for a while, but after seeing the great George Howell give a presentation and mention that he advocates freezing coffee, I decided to try for myself. It really does almost completely stop the staling process. If I freeze a bag on day 5, then in 2 months, the coffee will still bloom as if it is day 5 and still have all the flavors. People also get too complex with how to freeze. If I have a frozen coffee, I just pull the bag out, weigh the dose, squeeze the air out and put it back in right away so it doesn't defrost. If you want to buy a few coffees at once or a coffee catches your eye when you already have 1, this is a great option. I wouldn't freeze more than 3 months though as it will still eventually lose flavor.

I've been brewing coffee for over a year with a French Press with great success, and recently I've been trying cold brew. Originally I tried a Mason Jar with some cotton bags.

It's a bit short for the 64 oz Mason Jar (there are larger ones, which would probably be better for this size jar), but not too bad. However, I was only able to get \~4 oz course ground coffee in it. With \~60oz of water (7.5 cups), this is a ratio of 1/15 by weight, but the most common ratios seem to be 1/7-1/8. Looking through the Amazon questions section though, somebody said the filter could hold up to \~300g (10z) of course ground coffee, which would be more than enough for how much I am trying to brew (if I filled to the brim, I would only get 5oz or \~150g at the very most; that would leave no room for the grounds to expand though). Is it possible that I just have very light weight beans, and if I use other beans I might be able to get more coffee by weight into this filter?

So I decided to try this metal sieve instead since it would be much simpler to remove: &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0721RVRYN""&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0721RVRYN&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bit short for the 64 oz Mason Jar (there are larger ones, which would probably be better for this size jar), but not too bad. However, I was only able to get ~4 oz course ground coffee in it. With ~60oz of water (7.5 cups), this is a ratio of 1/15 by weight, but the most common ratios seem to be 1/7-1/8. Looking through the Amazon questions section though, somebody said the filter could hold up to ~300g (10z) of course ground coffee, which would be more than enough for how much I am trying to brew (if I filled to the brim, I would only get 5oz or ~150g at the very most; that would leave no room for the grounds to expand though). Is it possible that I just have very light weight beans, and if I use other beans I might be able to get more coffee by weight into this filter?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the beans I&amp;#39;m currently using by the way: &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LY95FBU""&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LY95FBU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Looking to benefit from your experience as I start building my setup.  I'm currently use my french press, blade grinder, and very cheap electric kettle (I estimate temperature by how the boiling water sounds) to produce some surprisingly decent coffee.  But as I'm about to have some disposable income I plan to upgrade a thing or two.  I'm too lazy to use a handgrinder so I'm looking electric, it will be dedicated to FP, pourover, and drip (espresso will be a breville 870 so no grinder to start and will buy different one if I find the need).   I don't want to feel like I overspent on it, but also don't want to buy another grinder that isn't for espresso any time soon. So far I keep changing my mind between encore, sette 270, and vario.  Certainly open to non-Baratza recs, just seems like everyone loves their customer service and that's reassuring.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts/advice on kettles would also be greatly appreciated.  So far probably going with the stagg but mostly because it looks cool.  I know it'll pour slower than I might wish it did for FP, but I'll use it for pourover and tea as well.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;tldr; Can you recommend a good electric grinder for FP, pourover, and drip?&lt;/p&gt;

Previously I was using a Chemex, so this isn't my first experience with pour over. But I prefer a bit more body and acidity than the Chemex offered.

I think my main question right now is grind size. I have a Baratza Encore, and I was previously using about a 12, which produced a fairly fine grind. I used 20g of coffee to about 300 mL water (a ratio I had success with using my Chemex, I also like my coffee on the stronger side). 

I added about 60g of water to bloom and simultaneously ""excavated"" the bottom to ensure all the grounds got saturated. Then topped it off, gave the grounds a stir, and slowly added enough water to bring it to 300 mL. The result was... ok. It produced a cup without much complexity and it honestly tasted a bit like charcoal. I'm using fresh, locally roasted beans from a shop down the street, so I know it shouldn't taste ""burnt"" like this.

This morning I adjusted the grind size to about a 20 on the Encore. It produced a much coarser grind. Even more coarse than I was expecting. It almost looked like something you'd use for French press. (Side note: I wonder if my years of taking it apart to clean it has somehow messed with the grind calibration?)

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

The taste, the smell, the ritual of pour overs and grinding, it’s like a defining characteristic. Also, I live in Seattle, so you’d think there would be no end of access. 

Problem is my doctor wants me to reduce my caffeine intake by as much as I can. I’m finally on a good medication protocol for my ADD and she wants me to finally reduce all other stimulants I’ve been using to self-treat all these years (dxed ADD-I in the past two years but I’ve been suffering/surviving with it for as long as I remember) so I’ve decided to only drink home brew and swear off coffee shops. 

I’ve tried the decaf version of my preferred bean (Vivace roast Cafe Vita) but either my regular brew methods don’t transfer or there really is something lost with the decaffeination process. 

Suggestions? I like dark/bold roasts, I tend to doctor it with a little cream and brown sugar, and I really should try to find some coffee that isn’t as acidic due to stomach acid problems. 

I don’t have the scratch to spend $15-30 experimenting with all kinds of blends. Reading this sub, it looks like many of you are the perfect combo of coffee snob, coffee educated, but don’t take yourselves too seriously. 

Given the above info, if you only had the ability to buy one bag of beans, what would you recommend for someone like me looking for a low caff/low acid whole bean with great aroma and bold taste (I mean, I’ll try ground but I really prefer to grind as I go) and I typically go through 2-6 cups of home brew a day depending on work load and other factors.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love coffee. The taste, the smell, the ritual of pour overs and grinding, it’s like a defining characteristic. Also, I live in Seattle, so you’d think there would be no end of access. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem is my doctor wants me to reduce my caffeine intake by as much as I can. I’m finally on a good medication protocol for my ADD and she wants me to finally reduce all other stimulants I’ve been using to self-treat all these years (dxed ADD-I in the past two years but I’ve been suffering/surviving with it for as long as I remember) so I’ve decided to only drink home brew and swear off coffee shops. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried the decaf version of my preferred bean (Vivace roast Cafe Vita) but either my regular brew methods don’t transfer or there really is something lost with the decaffeination process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestions? I like dark/bold roasts, I tend to doctor it with a little cream and brown sugar, and I really should try to find some coffee that isn’t as acidic due to stomach acid problems. &lt;/p&gt;

I used for a while an old , probably more then seventy years old, hand grinder with metal burr inherited by my grandparents which could not be disassembled, so I used to just clean it once in a while with the help of a brush.

However I recently switched to a more modern, adjustable, Hario hand grinder with ceramic burr and since this one can easily be disassembled and washed I wonder how often I should wash the ceramic burr. Unfortunately in the instruction manual there is no suggestion.

So I wonder: how often do you wash you burr? How often do you do it?

This was all discovered through conversations with the guys that work in their stores and although I knew that this kind of thing happens there I was surprised that a British, now Coca Cola owned, company is doing it. This is what I’ve learned so far, I’m still in contact with some of the guys so could reach out to them if anyone has questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Costa Staff don’t have their work visas provided by the company that runs the franchise out there. The company uses third parties, either Saudi individuals or companies to get work visas for their staff. Although this isn’t technically illegal it’s very shady.
2. During training a trainee was physically assaulted by a manager/trainer. He described it as “a smack” and indicated that he was hit somewhere on his upper body.
3. Staff have gone for several months without being paid. The longest period that I’m aware of was five months. These are people from developing countries who mostly traveled to Saudi to make money so that they can support their families back home. They were literally living off of the contents of the tip jar for five months.
4. Companies that employ foreign workers in Saudi have to provide them with either accommodation or an accommodation allowance. Costa provides them with an allowance of 200 Riyals per month, this is the equivalent of $54 and leads to their staff living in really cramped conditions in small apartments. I’m told up to five a room in some cases.
5. Many of the staff have been made to work seven days a week with no overtime. Even in Saudi this is illegal.
6. Some staff have been made to work in a store alone all day with no breaks. In one of these cases the store would open at 5am and closed at 8pm. The guy would show up at 4:30am and leave around 9pm for days in row.
7. After staff have finished their contract they often have to remain in Saudi, unpaid, for a month or more (sometimes two) while Costa arranges their flight home. The guys I spoke to were never really sure why but they were told by management that they were “waiting for a cheap flight”. This is unlikely to be the case and probably has something to do with their visas.
8. At least one of the stores is on a compound which is mostly inhabited by westerners. Costa get a unit in the small shopping center there rent free and the Costa staff are accommodated on the compound with the other guys that work there. When one of the Costa staff finished his contract he remained in his accommodation on the compound until Costa had arranged his flight which took over a month. After he’d left the compound’s management billed Costa for the time he was living there but not working. Costa deducted this cost from the SALARIES of their two staff that were still working in the store on the compound.
9. Around five years ago Costa accused one of their staff of petty theft, something which he denied. Costa filed a police report but the police were apparently unwilling or unable to anything due to lack of evidence without the staff member signing a confession, something he refused to do. Costa then fired him but refused to release his passport and iqama (work visa)………… for five years. The guy was in a foreign country for five years unable to travel home or find another job. He lived off of the charity of other Costa staff the whole time and was told by Costa management that if he signed a confession he would have to serve a year in prison and would then be sent home. I have a copy of the police report and had an Arabic speaker look at it. Had he signed it he would have apparently not only been given prison time but lashes too. The latter is something I’m told he was completely unaware of. He is apparently back home now but how he lasted half a decade under those conditions I do not know.

They’ve done other shady stuff like using non-Costa beans and misleading customers about their source (I can get photo evidence of this) but I wanted to focus on the way they treat their staff with this post.

I just wanted to get the word out about some of the things western companies and their franchises get up to in the Gulf. If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask. I’m also open to suggestions about how I could get this out to a wider audience.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Costa Coffee in Saudi Arabia treat their staff terribly by doing things like withholding wages and physically assaulting them, in one case they even prevented someone from leaving the country for five years.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for the gold!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was recently in Saudi Arabia and wanted to share some of the things I’ve learned about Costa Coffee’s practices out there. This was all discovered through conversations with the guys that work in their stores and although I knew that this kind of thing happens there I was surprised that a British, now Coca Cola owned, company is doing it. This is what I’ve learned so far, I’m still in contact with some of the guys so could reach out to them if anyone has questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costa Staff don’t have their work visas provided by the company that runs the franchise out there. The company uses third parties, either Saudi individuals or companies to get work visas for their staff. Although this isn’t technically illegal it’s very shady.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During training a trainee was physically assaulted by a manager/trainer. He described it as “a smack” and indicated that he was hit somewhere on his upper body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staff have gone for several months without being paid. The longest period that I’m aware of was five months. These are people from developing countries who mostly traveled to Saudi to make money so that they can support their families back home. They were literally living off of the contents of the tip jar for five months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies that employ foreign workers in Saudi have to provide them with either accommodation or an accommodation allowance. Costa provides them with an allowance of 200 Riyals per month, this is the equivalent of $54 and leads to their staff living in really cramped conditions in small apartments. I’m told up to five a room in some cases.&lt;/li&gt;

Since I can't brew at work, every weekday I make one big brew using 31g of coffee and 480g of water to yield just shy of 16oz of coffee. Until recently I had been using a V60 size 02 for this. I've practiced on the V60 for the past couple of years, and over the past year or so I've improved my grinder, my water, and my brewing technique considerably. In general I had been getting reasonably good results with these 31g V60 brews that I felt did the coffees justice.

On the other hand, on weekends I do various smaller brews using 18g in a Kalita 155. As on weekdays, on weekends I use a 15.5:1 water:coffee ratio and a Lido 3 grinder. In contrast to my weekday brews, the 18g 155 brews have been consistently amazing. In fact, much of the best coffee I've ever tasted I made using these parameters. Once dialed in precisely, the flavors are always super intense and well articulated and the balance and finish are excellent. Whereas the 31g V60 brews are somewhat dull, the 18g 155 brews are resonant.

That's why I switched to the Kalita 185 for my larger weekday brews--I figured I must be missing out and switched devices thinking the Wave might just be a better brewer (at least to my palate). As an initial matter, there's no obvious reason why either the V60 02 or the Kalita 185 would be more or less suitable for 31g; they have very similar dimensions and are recommended for similar quantities of coffee by the manufacturers.

Yet the results of the switch have been dramatic. The 31g brews in the 185 reliably have had better flavor clarity, more pronounced but finer acidity, and more sweetness as compared to the same size brews in the V60 02. At first I thought this confirmed my hypothesis, that the Wave is just a better brewer (again, at least for me).

However, based on a few comments I read here, I started thinking about the *relationship* between the dose and the brewer and whether that relationship, rather than the brewers by themselves, could explain the differences in taste. A couple of knowledgeable folks (mainly u/CommunistWitchDr) have argued that pour-over brewers in fact have narrow optimal ranges of doses and that going outside of those ranges leads to worse coffee.

The reasoning goes like this. Bed depth (which is a direct function of dose) strongly relates to flow rate, so as bed depth goes down, you need to grind finer and finer to get a good extraction. Finer grinds are generally desirable because they're more even than coarser grinds and therefore support more even extraction. However, grinding finer also creates more fines, because fines are generated as the coffee is broken apart. And, in addition to other problems, fines cause channeling--very briefly, uneven resistance to the water flowing through the coffee bed which causes water to ""channel,"" i.e. concentrate in particular areas and over-extract the adjacent grounds in the process. This can potentially ruin the flavor of an otherwise good pour-over.

By the same token, as bed depth goes up, you need to grind coarser and coarser to avoid killing the flow rate. The issues with coarse grinding are that (1) it's less even than finer grinding, and therefore leads to less even extraction, and (2) it's much less efficient because it exposes much less of the coffee's soluble material to water. At least for my taste preferences, coarse grinding should generally be avoided.

Taken together, these observations suggest that each pour-over brewer has an optimal range of doses. This is because each brewer has a unique shape and capacity, which together determine bed depth, which in turn dictates grind size. In the optimal range, the grind is fine enough to get a good, even extraction but not so fine that channeling becomes a problem.

This is not only supported by scientific theory--it has been borne out in my experience. The Kalita 185 brews 31g beautifully--with similar flavor clarity at presumably similar extraction levels as my favorite 18g 155 brews--but the V60 02 does not. Of course, the V60 is more than capable of producing incredible coffee, but it needs the right dose/grind to do so. This idea is also consistent with many pros' recommendations for V60 brewing, which typically involve around 22g doses for the 02 (and rarely, if ever, more than 25g).

I don't mean to suggest that this is a novel insight; it's not. I wanted to share anyway because it took me a while to fully understand, and has had a major, practical impact on the quality of my brewing. If you haven't already, I recommend evaluating if your dose makes sense for whatever pour-over brewer you're using, as well as experimenting with different doses in different brewers.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;All,&lt;/p&gt;

I have a really tiny kitchen and live in a noisy apartment where my downstairs neighbour will make my life miserable if I wake her up in the early morning with a coffee grinder :)

As I have learned the most important thing is a good grinder, I want to pick either the Eureka mignon Silenzio (369 eur =  416 usd)  or Eureka Mignon Specialita (429 eur = 484 usd), as they are both small and really quiet. Would the Specialita be worth the extra 70 euro's?

I would like to be able to make a good espresso and will use the machine a lot for making lattes. I would also like to learn more about making espresso but I am not sure if at this moment I can/want to spend a lot of time on it.

I previously opted for the Breville infuser, but after noticing the Bambino plus this seems like a really good choice as its a) Really small b) Startup time 3secs (I am always in a hurry in the  morning. c) The automatic frother function that actually makes microfoam froth really calls my name and saves time! d) Seems to be a bit easier in use, so I wont have a lot of wasted shots/frustration?

As there is the option to do manual frothing as well and I can buy non-pressurised baskets, there would be some opportunity for me to have a bit of a learning curve I guess?

I can get the Bambino plus for 449 eur (= 506 usd), which seems a bit steep for what you get, and the infuser for 473 eur (=533 usd). The infuser is not big but still twice as wide as the Bambino.

Cool your hot, freshly brewed coffee in a cocktail shaker full of ice. 

So this is the recipe. You will either need a higher concentration of coffee or just deal with slightly watery coffee. Imo it’s not that watery.

- Fill a metal (must be metal) cocktail shaker with ice. 
- Let it sit and chill closed while your coffee brews. This is awesome if you use a k-cup or similar machines. 
- While it brews, make sure to add any cream and sugar to your shaker. This is also where you can add other fancy stuff too like flavorings.
- Fill the cup you plan on drinking coffee out of with ice (you can add your cream or flavorings here instead, but I highly suggest adding sugar directly to the shaker)
- Pour slightly less coffee than you would normally use into the shaker. You can do this immediately after brewing, or even brew the cup directly in the shaker if it fits under your k-cup spout. 
- Shake your cocktail shaker. You should feel the outside of the shaker go cold in seconds. Shake until the outside is basically ice cold to the touch.
- Take the small lid off the shaker and strain the coffee through the lid into your cup of ice.
- Enjoy!

I make coffee like this at my work everyday (we have a k-cup machine) since I don’t like hot coffee. Also, I keep my shaker in the freezer at work so it is constantly ice cold.

Awesome little device and looks great on the counter-top, or anywhere, really. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I pulled two shots, from a semi-automatic (with PID control) and the Flair. I tried to use the same variables 14g / 27 secs brew time (this is how I usually pull this type of bean from the semi-automatic; I also set the temp at 195F which was recommended by the roaster) and same grind level. The shot from the Flair came out a tad bit bitter and a more watery (and a lot less crema). I think it was an okay shot for milk-based drink, but a bit lacking if it’s straight up. 

My kettle doesn’t have temperature control and the manual force to pull down is not as consistent (and I don’t know whether I’m pulling 30lbs) since I don’t have the pressure gauge, but I tried to keep my process consistent throughout by first warming up the brew head once the water from the kettle is boiled, then proceed to grind out the beans and pour water into the chamber. 

Any tips?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awesome little device and looks great on the counter-top, or anywhere, really. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I pulled two shots, from a semi-automatic (with PID control) and the Flair. I tried to use the same variables 14g / 27 secs brew time (this is how I usually pull this type of bean from the semi-automatic; I also set the temp at 195F which was recommended by the roaster) and same grind level. The shot from the Flair came out a tad bit bitter and a more watery (and a lot less crema). I think it was an okay shot for milk-based drink, but a bit lacking if it’s straight up. &lt;/p&gt;

Wanted to get your thoughts on the taste profile of brewed coffee from grinding frozen beans vs. room temp ground beans.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to be universally accepted that if you want to preserve the taste of coffee for a month or longer, then vacuum sealed freezing is probably the best way to do it. Here is a Redditor reporing a [1-month taste test](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/8ynqfc/george_howell_on_freezing_coffee/) with an outcome favoring the frozen beans, and a good discussion can be found at that link.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm curious about is the taste profile of grinding the frozen beans vs. letting them thaw and grinding them at room temp. Which creates a superior cup?

&amp;#x200B;

Opinion: I prefer the taste of the coffee from the room-temp ground beans. More below

=====================

Context:

[George Howell](http://www.georgehowellcoffee.com/knowledge/notes-from-george/) (see issue 2 on this page) recommends grinding the frozen beans as they grind more evenly .

[This nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep24483) (figure 4), shows a more narrow grind distribution AND a shift towards finer grind particles the colder the beans are when ground.

The author of this [excellent coffee blog,](https://coffeeadastra.com) recommends thawing the beans a few hours prior to grinding given the larger number of fines. (click on the V60 recipe link to read about it).

====================

Very unofficial taste test:

Using a Colombian from Heart coffee, I brewed with my V60, a Comandante and third wave water on day 10 after roast. Dialing in, I ultimately landed on click 23.  Round, delicious, balanced flavor.  Lingering, tasty finish.

I then froze those beans overnight (not-vacuum sealed, simply in a zip lock bag) and ground them frozen the next morning using the same recipe. The flavor was a little more... sharp? Not as round. Not as balanced. Played around with a click finer, a click courser, and found that one click courser produced a better cup, but still not quite as round and balanced as the beans at room-temp.

I thawed them overnight and brewed again the next day. Back to click 23. Again, an excellent, round, balanced cup. From my memory, very similar to the excellent cup on the first brew, day 10 off roast, with the room-temp beans.

&amp;#x200B;

I could theorize a little and suggest that it makes sense I preferred a courser grind setting with the frozen beans, if in fact the frozen grind leads to a finder grind (at the same grind setting). Though if the distribution is tighter with the frozen grind, then I would have thought this would lead to more cup clarity and thus a preferred taste. But this wasn't the case.  Of course, this is just ONE test with ONE type of bean. So, yeah, very unscientific. Essentially this is just fodder for conversation more than anything else.

Some tips for people doing this in the future:

1) Getting the case off is a bitch. Pry in with a screwdriver, and slide the case off as you hold the top part of the case to make it easier

2) To take the shaft off of the burr, you need to hold the burr with a towel (or you'll rip your skin off) and turn the shaft while in the towel with a wrench. It should pop off with some force.

3) Some people complained about the beans not grinding after repair. Make sure that the red wire that you connect is plugged to the + point on the circuit board in the unit.

The Gaggia had a real creativity factor as it isn't so fine tuned like other automatic machines so I'm mixing up my grind, my tamp pressure, total time etc to try and perfect it.

This is the first time I've made espresso with a machine and I'm loving it.

If anyone could give some tips I would greatly appreciate it. I'll be testing my pressure on the weekend and adjusting to 10 bar. 

Coffee is pretty decent so far just slightly sour and I'm getting a wet puck using the double basket and double spout. What could I do to fix?

I went on my first trip bringing my own coffee setup.  It took up [over 2/3](https://imgur.com/a/lUjX6ju) of my carry on suitcase!  I did put additional clothes over it but you can clearly see how much room it took up.  I could have taken the stuff out of the boxes, but I don't think it would have saved much room.  So now since I'm more serious into coffee and I have a couple of long trips overseas plus camping trips, I decided to put together a real travel setup.  This is designed for maximum compactness, ie air travel.  if you're not traveling by air and have more room to bring stuff, then you can modify as needed.

&amp;#x200B;

[Now here's what I'm currently using.](https://imgur.com/a/Gg6ALI4)

&amp;#x200B;

1, Aeropress with tote bag - $31.95 [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018RY8H0](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018RY8H0)

I went with the aeropress since I prefer it over the drippers, and so the rest of my equipment is slightly more geared towards having an aeropress, but you can use a v60 or whatever method you like.  I do see that an [Aeropress Go](https://dailycoffeenews.com/2019/03/15/aeropress-on-the-move-with-the-forthcoming-aeropress-go/) will be released in the fall which is slightly smaller and every will fit into a travel cup, so that might be worth looking into as well when it comes out, but right now the standard aeropress makes the perfect sized cup for me right now \~230ml.  One thing I really hate is that the filter cap can't be attached when the plunger is all the way pressed, I feel like I could just shave off some plastic on the filter cap to get it to screw in since it's really the notches that are too thick preventing it from turning.  The exposed rubber on the plunger gets excessively dirty from random stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Aeropress filter container - $6.00 [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FSQ2LHW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FSQ2LHW)

This is great for protecting and holding the filters.  It holds about 100 filters.  Definitely enough for say a month's worth.  Or you can get a metal filter, but I prefer the paper ones.  Also, you can even reuse the paper filters up to 80 times according to the inventor, just rinse an dry after each use.

&amp;#x200B;

3. .5L Kettle Dual Voltage - $32.99 [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JDZHJV](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JDZHJV)

The black carrying bag came with the kettle and it fits everything nicely.  You can save some bucks and get a non dual voltage kettle.  The thing is so light and tiny that it's pretty easy to control the pour, so no gooseneck needed.  Super amazed at the size of this kettle, so tiny compared to the 1.7L.  It also boils water in 2:30, and is dual voltage (though on 220V they say it takes longer to boil water).  Will be useful to have when I travel overseas, also came with a travel adapter.  I know a lot of places will have hot water capabilities, but I don't want to leave anything to chance.  For camping, I have a regular 2qt stovetop kettle, space won't be an issue for camping.

&amp;#x200B;

4. 0.1g Scale - $10.99 [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DGEWHN4](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DGEWHN4)

Having a scale is a must, you can buy one with a built in timer as well, but those are bigger or more expensive, I just used my phone as the timer.  I found this scale was pretty accurate using the weight of a US quarter as 5.670 grams it consistently read between 5.6 or 5.7g.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Aergrind - \~$120 [cosmetic 2nd](http://www.madebyknock.com/store/p39/Aergrind.html) from MBK website for 97 GBP \~= $122 USD (stock runs out fast on this).  Or Prima coffee sometimes has stock on new and used aergrinds, but is more expensive.

Aergrind is probably the best grinder you can get that fits inside the plunger of an aeropress.  It does stick out a bit but saves room.  I do not use the funnel for the aeropress.  I weigh the beans into the catch cup and it's small enough so there's no spilling.  You can also get a porlex mini or a rhino compact, both will fit in the plunger as well and the rhino has an adapter to grind directly into the aeropress.  I will likely keep my Lido ET and use it when I have more space, ie camping or car traveling.

&amp;#x200B;

I should also note that the lid of the kettle opens up as wide as the kettle is and there's additional room in there for storage.  Probably can fit in 1 16oz ""fat"" bag of coffee.  The ""tall skinny"" type of bags would be too tall, but you can fold it.

You people are insanely knowledgeable, so I was hoping you could help me out.   

&amp;#x200B;

I drink french press coffee twice a day as a preworkout source of caffeine. I'm not a fan of formula or powdered preworkouts. I generally have between 200-300mg of caffeine daily. This equates to around 30oz of coffee. That's a lot of liquid and acidity, which is sometimes hard on my stomach. I'm a fan of espresso style coffee for the flavor and concentration, but lack the budget to do espresso correctly. Thus, my newly acquired aeropress.   

&amp;#x200B;

I know that aeropress coffee will never truly be espresso, but I am looking for a more concentrated conveyor of caffeine. I'd like to consume 150-200mg, twice a day. I've tried a 1:4 ratio of grams of coffee to water, pouring at 205\^f, using the double filter tamped method HomeGrounds recommended.(Wet filter, place and tamp coffee, leave second filter on top of puck, pour water and immediately press.) 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I have the puzzle pieces of good and strong coffee, but have no idea if I'm putting them together correctly. Do you recommend that I tweak my ratio? My brewing method? Is there a way to calculate how much caffeine I'm taking in with my current ratio?

And also a question. I'll start with the question

1. Have you experienced that there is an ideal brewed volume for a brewing device? Specifically, I'm using a V60, 02. Been brewing for couple years, and as I'm usually the only coffee drinker in the house, I usually just brew anywhere from 15-20 grams of coffee. However, using the method below as recommended by my local shop, I brew 25 grams. They use a 1:15 ratio (375g of water). And... not sure if its the recipe itself, or the volume, but my cups have been noticeably improved and consistently delicious. I guess I'll try this next...but I would think that theoretically, if I only used 12 grams, appropriately tightened my grind size, and otherwise used the same method that I could get the same cup. But maybe a particular volume will intrinsically lead to a better brew? Just curious your experience regarding the best brew volume for the V60, 02 size.

And then for anyone curious, I've really been obtaining consistently tasty coffee with the following. (same method used by my favorite local coffee shop):

\- So its essentially the [Rao method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0Qe_ASxfNM), with some minor differences.

\-Using a V60 02, Comandante grinder (usually between 23 and 25 clicks), Third wave water  \*(one packet per two gallons), @ 208 degrees F

1. Using a 1:15 ratio. 25g coffee, 375g water.
2. Bloom 4x the water weight with 100 grams within 15 seconds or so
3. Stir the slurry. Just like my local shop, I use a fairly large wooden spoon and gently move the grounds back and forth 4x north/south, then 4x east/west (okay not EXACTLY those cardinal directions, but you get the idea). In the past, I'd use a small spoon and kind of erratically stir. Really don't know if switching to a larger spoon and being more gentle changes anything...but as mentioned...brews have been great.
4. After 45 seconds, single pour the rest, up to 375g. Circles and zig-zags, just with a consistent pour rate. Finish this by around 1:30. Nearly fills the whole thing up
5. Gently spin to help achieve a flat bed
6. Finishes anywhere between 2:50 and 4 mins depending on the bean

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway...sometimes achieving a good pour over can be frustrating. Just a few things I've found that have made a difference. I now consistently prefer my V60 to my Kalita wave. And I had that pretty well dialed in using the [George Howell method](http://www.georgehowellcoffee.com/brew-guide/kalita-185/). Perhaps, as some suggested by some on this sub, all this fussing over the pour routine is a lot of sound and fury with little meaning...but its what is working for me at the moment. Give it a shot!

&amp;#x200B;

\*A word on third wave water. I've consistently found that using one packet with two gallons (a 50% dilution) achieves a better cup than one packet with one gallon. Anyone else experienced this?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is just another &amp;quot;share what&amp;#39;s working for me&amp;quot; at the moment in hopes of helping anyone else looking for guidance on a good pour over routine. And also a question. I&amp;#39;ll start with the question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you experienced that there is an ideal brewed volume for a brewing device? Specifically, I&amp;#39;m using a V60, 02. Been brewing for couple years, and as I&amp;#39;m usually the only coffee drinker in the house, I usually just brew anywhere from 15-20 grams of coffee. However, using the method below as recommended by my local shop, I brew 25 grams. They use a 1:15 ratio (375g of water). And... not sure if its the recipe itself, or the volume, but my cups have been noticeably improved and consistently delicious. I guess I&amp;#39;ll try this next...but I would think that theoretically, if I only used 12 grams, appropriately tightened my grind size, and otherwise used the same method that I could get the same cup. But maybe a particular volume will intrinsically lead to a better brew? Just curious your experience regarding the best brew volume for the V60, 02 size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then for anyone curious, I&amp;#39;ve really been obtaining consistently tasty coffee with the following. (same method used by my favorite local coffee shop):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- So its essentially the &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0Qe_ASxfNM""&gt;Rao method&lt;/a&gt;, with some minor differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Using a V60 02, Comandante grinder (usually between 23 and 25 clicks), Third wave water  *(one packet per two gallons), @ 208 degrees F&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a 1:15 ratio. 25g coffee, 375g water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bloom 4x the water weight with 100 grams within 15 seconds or so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stir the slurry. Just like my local shop, I use a fairly large wooden spoon and gently move the grounds back and forth 4x north/south, then 4x east/west (okay not EXACTLY those cardinal directions, but you get the idea). In the past, I&amp;#39;d use a small spoon and kind of erratically stir. Really don&amp;#39;t know if switching to a larger spoon and being more gentle changes anything...but as mentioned...brews have been great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 45 seconds, single pour the rest, up to 375g. Circles and zig-zags, just with a consistent pour rate. Finish this by around 1:30. Nearly fills the whole thing up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gently spin to help achieve a flat bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finishes anywhere between 2:50 and 4 mins depending on the bean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway...sometimes achieving a good pour over can be frustrating. Just a few things I&amp;#39;ve found that have made a difference. I now consistently prefer my V60 to my Kalita wave.

As such, I’m starting the process of researching new gear (mainly grinders) as my current grinder, an original Baratza Sette 270W, produces a lot of fines and boulders on its coarsest setting (based on using a Kruve to dial in), and very few grounds in the sweet spot. It’s definitely doable and usable due to cold brews forgiving nature but grinding coarse is not what the Sette 270 is intended for. 

Being that the Forte BG is a commercial rated grinder and I know it would be a bit overkill for the few times a month that I’d need to use it to grind up a week's worth of cold brew at a time, but I’m ok with that. After selling my current gear, I figure my budget would be in the $1,000 range so I’d like to invest in the best equipment I can afford. 

So that’s my question, **is the Forte BG the best sub-$1,000 grinder you’d recommend for grinding coarse &amp; medium-coarse coffee for cold brew?**

Thanks in advance for any advice or tips you wish to share! :)

*Edit: Some additional details that may help explain our desire for a BG or similar high-end solution:* 

* After brewing our cold (immersion) brew coffee, we filter it through a Chemex filter; however, due to the extreme amount of fines from the Sette, that filtering process takes over 30 minutes (I could swap out multiple filters part of the way through, but that feels like a big waste). I'm hoping a more appropriate grinder, like the BG, would help significantly in this area as well, in addition to getting us closer to a slow-drip flavor profile.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have had to switch from espresso to cold brew (both immersion and slow drip) due to our stomachs no longer being able to handle what I’m guessing is the acidity in other brew methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s a lot but any information or experience at all is helpful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also for my drink of choice I prefer a cortado  so 1:1 ratio of milk to espresso.  Or at most a latte&lt;/p&gt;
